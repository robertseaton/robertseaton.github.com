Hey, remember when I promised that book reviews were going to become a regular
thing around here? -- you know, in my
[*Born to Run* review and summary](http://rs.io/2014/07/10/born-to-run-review.html),
where I said: "I plan for this to be the first in a very long tradition of
reviewing books, so stay tuned for more."

Well, now that I've
published [reflections on one month vegan](http://rs.io/2014/07/21/reflections-on-a-month-vegan.html),
it's time to stop procrastinating and post another one. Today, it's Joe Sugarman's *Advertising Secrets of
the Written Word: The Ultimate Resource on How to Write Powerful Advertising
Copy from One of America's Top Copywriters and Mail Order Entrepreneurs*.

Which I'd like to give the award, "longest title ever." Except it's
not. There's a book by Nigel Tomm that has a 670 word title. 644 words longer
than this book.

So Nigel Tomm has Joe Sugarman beat.

But back to the review. What'd I think? -- wait, wait, more on that later. First I have to tell you what the book is
about.

## Summary of <em>Advertising Secrets of the Written Word</em>

Joe Sugarman is, ostensibly, a legend. At least, according to
[KISSmetrics](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/joseph-sugarman/), [American Writer's
and Artists, Inc.](http://www.awaionline.com/2011/05/joe-sugarman-to-speak-at-bootcamp-2011/),
and
[creativepublic.com](http://creativepublic.com/book-review-triggers-joe-sugarman.php).

In what is, I'm sure, an unrelated, complete coincidence, this is also how the
endorsements *printed on* Joe Sugarman's books describe Joe Sugarman.

Which is to imply that, if you write a book and describe yourself as a
world-renowned Gorilla wrestler on the jacket, well, blogs everywhere will
report that you're a world-renowned Gorilla wrestler.

At which point, you sorta will be a world-renowned Gorilla wrestler, and you
didn't even have to wrestle any Gorillas. 

And, if you think that's bad, just remember: Wikipedia is a collection of facts,
some cited, some not, and the good ones, the cited ones, are referring to the
equivalent of you calling yourself a Gorilla wrestler on the book jacket.

So there's that.

But I'm off topic. Joe Sugarman is a legend because he's convinced people to buy
a lot of junk that they don't need.

I mean, that's not what people *say*. They say he's a "legendary copywriter who
started a mail-order business, JS&A Group, through the power of his pen."

Which translates to him selling people a lot of junk that they don't need. Like
sunglasses that block the color blue.

The book, then, is about teaching you to write in such a way that you, too, can
sell people a bunch of junk that they don't need. Or, at least, further your
agenda with text, whatever that agenda may be -- which is the reason that I
picked up the book. I'd like to be able to convince people to do stuff with
words.

And, I figure, if you can get someone to read about something as prosaic as a
washing machine, you can get them to read about anything.

So how, according to the book, do you write great copy?
