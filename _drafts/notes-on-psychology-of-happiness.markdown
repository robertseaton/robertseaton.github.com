## Introduction

Happiness and meaning in life were rated as much more important in producing the
good life than moral goodness and going to heaven.<a href="#1-citation"><sup>1</sup></a>

Happiness has sometimes been measured by an answer to a single question, but
this has led to some very improbable results.

According to one survery, there are 17 papers on depression for every one
paper on happiness.

Well-being is different from subjective well-being in that well-being usually
considers objective measures of things such as health or income.

Argyle believes that the main causes of happiness are relationships, work, and
leisure.

The main motivation of leisure activity is often to enjoy social relations, real
or imaginary.

Watching television can have positive effects for the socially isolated.

Soldiers expect more fear of a difficult parachute jump than actually
happens. Dental patients expect more pain from a procedure than actually
happens.

People say that money is not important to happiness and they are
correct. However, their behavior suggests that they think money is very
important. (Lowenstein and Shkade, 1999).

Social skills training is an effective intervention for depression and for
improving social relationships among the non-depressed.

Increased exercise can improve the happiness of both depressed and normal
populations.

Smaller organizations with flatter hierarchies and more employee input on
decisions have greater well-being.

## How to measure and study happiness

Brandstatter (1991) using experience sampling found that people are in a
positive emotional state 68% of the time. (pg. 8)

Single question job satisfaction correlates .67 with longer scales. (pg. 9)

The Oxford Happiness Inventory has better retest validity than the Beck
Depression Inventory, correlates with rating by friends, and has strong and
predicted relations with personality dimensions, stress, and social
support. (pg. 11)

Andrews and McKennel (1980) found that happiness correlated more affective
factors than cognitive factors (satisfaction). 

Suh et al. (1997) reported that the average correlation for affect balance and
satisfaction was .41, but higher for individualist nations, where it was over
.50.

Positive affect and negtive affect correlate at about -.43. (Tellegen et al.,
1988) (pg. 14)

Headey and Wearing (1992) found that depression and anxiety correlated at .50,
suggesting that negative affect consists of separable components. (pg. 14)

Most people are well above average happiness, 6 or 7 on a 9 point ladder
(Andrews and Withy, 1976). (pg. 17)

Most people in Britain say they are happily married, but half will get
divorced. (pg. 17)

Life satisfaction has been found to correlate with measures of self-deception
(Hagedorn, 1996).

Austria and Nigeria had the same level of subjective satisfaction, but Austria
scored 71 and Nigeria 30 on the Quality of Life Index. (Diener and Suh 1997a)
(pg. 19)

Clark and Oswald (1996) found that satisfaction with income had no relation to
actual income, but satisfaction was greater for those who expected
less. (pg. 20)

Unemployment affects mental health and mental health affects likelihood of
unemployment, but causation is stronger in the direction of unemployment-mental
heal. (pg. 21)

High levels of well-being increase extraversion. (Headey, Holstrom, and Wearing,
1984). (pg. 21)

## Joy and other positive emotions

People have a number of negative moods, but really only one positive mood,
joy. (pg.23)

Emotions can be plotted among two axis happy-sad and excited-calm. (pg. 24)

The intensity of positive emotions correlated with extraversion at .41 and the
intensity of negative emotions with neuroticism at .64. (pg. 26)

Thinking about and talking to others about positive events produces positive
moodes (Argyle and Martin, 1991).

Seven emotions can be reliably discrimnated by others in most cultures. (pg. 28)

Monkeys reared in isolation can recognize happy versus angry. (pg. 28)

It is an increasingly widely held view that there are a limited number of basic
emotion, perhaps seven, that have been hardwired into the brain by
evolution. (Ekman, 1982) (pg. 28)

In Japan there is a rule about not showing negative faces in public. (pg. 29)

Smiles and frowns leads to enhancement of the corresponding moods. (pg. 29)

Facial expressions may express emotions, but their real purpose may to be to
communicate with others. Facial expressions occur when people are alone, but
they are much weaker. (pg. 29)

Voice tone leaks more emotions than the face. (pg. 30)

There is no particular body posture corresponding to joy. (pg. 30)

Frequency of contact with friends, and of sexual intercourse, come out strongly
related to happiness. (Veenhoven, 1994).

The most common sources of joy (pg. 31):
* Eating
* Social activities and sex
* Exercise and sport
* Alcohol and other drugs
* Success and social approval
* Use of skills
* Music, the other arts and religion
* Weather and environment
* Rest and relaxation

Social activities and sex are the most common sources of positive
emotion. (pg. 31)

Exercise is the easiest and most powerful way of inducing positive emotion in
experimental conditions. (pg. 32)

People are in a better mood when the sun is shining, it is warm but not too
warm, and humidity is low. (Cunningham, 1979), but there is a high degree of
adaptation to the weather. (pg. 33)

Larson et al. (1984) foud that alochol produced positive emotions along all the
scales they used. (pg. 36)

## Satisfaction

Cummins (1998) concluded that most studies report an average of 70% of the
maximum of the satisfaction scale.

The effect of life satisfaction on job satisfaction is stronger than vice
versa. (Diener et al., 1999), (pg. 44)

In one study, asked if they would choose the same profession again, 91% of
mathematicians and 82% of lawyers said they would, compared wth 16% of unskilled
steel workers. (pg. 44)

Widows are about four times more likely (42% vs 10%) to be depressed than the
married. (pg. 44)

Leisure satisfaction has been found to be more related to total satisfaction
than any other domain in some studies. (pg. 45)

Watching TV is sometimes found to have a negative relationship with
satisfaction, probably because those watching TV have nothing better to
do. (pg. 45)

Adams (1997) found that objective indicators for Black Americans declined from
1980 to 1992, but life satisfaction increased. (pg. 46)

Strack et al. (1990) found that being with a handicapped confederate who seemed
1to be on a kidney dialysis machine increased the well-being of real
subjects. (pg. 46)

For individuals with the same income, living in a richer or poorer area had no
effect on subjective well-being.

Schulz and Decker (1985) found, in a study of 100 disabled individuals, reported
satisfaction was lower than the general population 20 years after the
accident. (pg. 48)

The disabled are less satisfied than those who acquired their injuries at birth
or early in life. (Mehnert et al., 1990) (pg. 48)

Strack et al. (1985) found that asking subjects to think about pleasant events
in the present or recent past, but for past events there was more effect on
well-being from thinking about negative events. Past events are used to
contrast, while present events are used as evidence of well-being. (pg. 50)

## Humour and laughter

Finding things funny happens about 18 times a day, most often in spntaneous
response to situations in the presence of others. (Martin and Kuiper, 1999)
(pg. 54)

There are different kinds of jokes, but so far no agreed classification of
them. (pg. 54)

Ruch and Carrell (1998), using 263 American and 151 German adults, found very
high correlations, .80 or more, between a cheerfulness inventory and Ruch's
sense of humor scale. (pg. 54)

Extraverts laugh more. (pg. 54)

Houston et al. (1998) found that a laughter-inducing sing-song in an old
people's home led to reduced levels of anxiety and depression. (pg. 55)

It seems that only in the apes that have had a lot of human contact and been
taught sign-language can something like humor can be seen. (pg. 55)

Most adult humor contains sexual, aggressive, or hostile components. (pg. 57)

By age 6 there is a gender difference; boys tell more jokes and fool about more
than girls. (pg. 57)

The central feature of events that makes them funny is incongruity. (pg. 58)

Extraversion is usually found to correlate with sense of humor as measured by
the 3WD test, and extraverts like sexual jokes the most. (pg. 60)

Humour makes young people more attractive to one another. (Lundy et al. 1998)

Keltner et al. (1998) found that in romantic couples teasing led to increased
flirtation and positive affect. (pg. 62)

For males who laughed a lot, stressful events led to an increase in positive
affect. Kuniper et al. 1992 (pg. 62)

Children who initiate a lot of humor have often experienced a period of
rejection early in life. (pg. 65)

Jokes were found funnier when they esteemed a subject's own group or one with
which he identified, and when they disparaged groups to which he did not belong
or identify with. La Fave et al. (1976)

Jokes may be an indirect way of expressing hostile attitudes. (pg. 66)

Graham (1995) asked pairs of stranger to talk for 30 minutes; a strong sense of
humor led to reduction of social distance between them. (pg. 68)

Grammer (1990) found that young men indicated their sexual interest by laughter
combined with bodily  posture. (pg. 68)

Decker and Rotondo (1999) found that job satisfaction as greater when
supervisors were rated as having a good sense of humor, espcially female
supervisors. (pg. 68)

When humor is used in public speaking, the speaker is liked more, the audience
are in a better modd, and the speech is found more interesting. (pg. 69)

Teachers are like more if they use humor. (pg. 69)

The key to most humor is entertaining two versions of events, or stories, where
the second and unexpected one is less worthy, e.g. ruder, than the
first. (pg. 69)

# Social relationships

Infant monkeys rared in total isolation start to discriminate friendly and
threatening faces at 2 months, so this ability must be largely innate. (Sackett,
1996) (pg. 74)

Lu and Argyle (1992b) found that extraverts gave more social support than
introverts did. (pg. 74)

Weiss (1973) found that to avoid loneliness people needed a single close
relationship and also a network of relationships. (pg. 75)

Wheeler et al. (1983) fond that a number of students who had plenty of friends
and spent a lot of time with them  were still lonely becayse they talked about
impersonal topics. (pg. 75)

Friendships were most often lose by individuals breaking such "third party
rules" as keeping confidences and standing up for friends in their
absence. (Argyle and Henderson, 1985). (pg. 75)

The best predictor of not being lonely is the frequency of interaction with
women; time spent with men made no difference. (Wheeler at al. 1983). (pg. 75)

Extraverts are more assertive and more cooperative, making them able to manage
their relationships better (Argyle and Lu, 1990).

Ross and Mirowsky (1989) found that social support led to less depression, but
that intimate conversations about problems made things worse since this meant
talking about problems, or complaining, rather tan solving them. (pg. 76)

Bereavement is more damaging for men than women. (pg. 79)

Being in love is good for health. Smith and Hoklund (1988) found that Danish
students who were in love had a higher white blood cell count, and had fewer
sore thorats, colds, or afters-effects of drinking than those not in love. (pg. 80)

The overall effect of having children on the happiness of their parets is zero
(Veenhoven, 1994). (pg. 82)

There are two bad periods for marital happiness: when there are very young
children and when they are adolescents. (pg. 82)

Favorite cousins in later life are those who were childhood playmates (Adams,
1968). (pg. 84)

Couples with children live longer. (Kobrin and Hendershot, 1977), (pg. 84).

Headey (1999) found that only 11% of those who had dogs were on some medication
compared with 19% of those with no pets; the pets ownders went to the doctor
less too. (pg. 85)

Hall and Nelson (1996) found that the well-being of a sample of patients
depended on the percentage of women in their networks, providing social
support. (pg. 86)

Argyle and Furnham (1983) found that the spouse was the greatest source of
conflict as well as of satisfaction. (pg. 86)

# Work and employment

In a survey of 7000 workers from nine European countries, Clark (1998a) found
that 42% reported having high job satisfaction. (pg. 89)

The overall correlation between pay and job satisfaction is low, typically .15
to .17, so pay is not an important cause of job satisfaction. (pg. 91)

Those doing voluntary work ares ometimes found to enjoy their work as much or
more than paid workers (Furnham and Argyle, 1998). (pg. 91)

A meta-analysis of job status found a rather modest overall correlation of .18
with job satisfaction (Haring et al., 1984).

For European workers, having "good relations" at work, with management and
colleagues, was the strongest predictor of job satisfaction. (pg. 93)

There is a U-shaped curve to job satisfaction, such that the young and the old
tend to be more satisfied with their jobs (Clark et al., 1996) (pg. 95).


Arvey et al. (1994) studied 2200 pairs of twins and found that 30% of the
variability of in job satisfaction could be explained by genetic factors
(pg. 96).

Furnham and Schaeffer (1984) found there was more satisfaction if an
individual's profile of needs matched the profile of rewards offered by the
job. (pg. 96)

American surveys have found that 10-12% of the unemployed described themselves
as "very ahppy" compared with 30% of the general population. This effect is
causal. (Warr, 1978) (pg. 103)

Clark et al. (1996) conclude that the effect of job loss on general mental
health is worse than that of divorce. (pg. 104)

Murphy and Athanasou (1999) carried out a meta-analysis and found that starting
work led to increased mental health witht an effect size of .54, while losing a
job led to deterioration with an effect size of .36. (pg. 104)

In Britain it has been found that income explains less than a quarter of the
reduction of GHQ scores for the unemployed (Clark, 1998b).

Unemployment creats more distress for those high in neuroticism (Payne, 1988),
introversion, and for type A personalities. (pg. 105)

The unemployed structure their time less (Feather and Bond, 1983) and this is a
cause of lower psychological health (Wanberg et al,, 1997).

When voluntary workers are compared with paid workers doing the same work, the
voluntary workers have been found to have higher job satisfaction (Pearce,
1993).

On average the retired are happier than those at work. (pg. 107)

American studies find no difference in mental health before and after retirement
(Kasl, 1980).

# Leisure

Several studies have found a negative relation between TV watching and
happiness. (pg. 112)

Thayer (1989) found that a 10-minute brisk walk resulted n less tiredness, more
energy, and less tension 2 hours later. Other studies found that after an hour's
exercise, such as aerobics, those involved felt less tense, depressed, angry,
tired or confused, and had more vigour, for the rest of the day and, in some,
for the next day (Maroulakis and Zervas, 1993). (pg. 113)

Paffenbarger el at. (1991) followed up 17,000 Harvard alumni over a period of 16
years and found fewer heart attacks for those who did more exercise. Thirty
minutes a day was enough to give maximum benefits. There were 31% fewer
deahts. (pg. 115)

Former athletes have been found to live longer than non-athlets (Shepherd,
1997). (pg. 115)
