## Introduction

Happiness and meaning in life were rated as much more important in producing the
good life than moral goodness and going to heaven.<a href="#1-citation"><sup>1</sup></a>

Happiness has sometimes been measured by an answer to a single question, but
this has led to some very improbable results.

According to one survery, there are 17 papers on depression for every one
paper on happiness.

Well-being is different from subjective well-being in that well-being usually
considers objective measures of things such as health or income.

Argyle believes that the main causes of happiness are relationships, work, and
leisure.

The main motivation of leisure activity is often to enjoy social relations, real
or imaginary.

Watching television can have positive effects for the socially isolated.

Soldiers expect more fear of a difficult parachute jump than actually
happens. Dental patients expect more pain from a procedure than actually
happens.

People say that money is not important to happiness and they are
correct. However, their behavior suggests that they think money is very
important. (Lowenstein and Shkade, 1999).

Social skills training is an effective intervention for depression and for
improving social relationships among the non-depressed.

Increased exercise can improve the happiness of both depressed and normal
populations.

Smaller organizations with flatter hierarchies and more employee input on
decisions have greater well-being.

## How to measure and study happiness

Brandstatter (1991) using experience sampling found that people are in a
positive emotional state 68% of the time. (pg. 8)

Single question job satisfaction correlates .67 with longer scales. (pg. 9)

The Oxford Happiness Inventory has better retest validity than the Beck
Depression Inventory, correlates with rating by friends, and has strong and
predicted relations with personality dimensions, stress, and social
support. (pg. 11)

Andrews and McKennel (1980) found that happiness correlated more affective
factors than cognitive factors (satisfaction). 

Suh et al. (1997) reported that the average correlation for affect balance and
satisfaction was .41, but higher for individualist nations, where it was over
.50.

Positive affect and negtive affect correlate at about -.43. (Tellegen et al.,
1988) (pg. 14)

Headey and Wearing (1992) found that depression and anxiety correlated at .50,
suggesting that negative affect consists of separable components. (pg. 14)

Most people are well above average happiness, 6 or 7 on a 9 point ladder
(Andrews and Withy, 1976). (pg. 17)

Most people in Britain say they are happily married, but half will get
divorced. (pg. 17)

Life satisfaction has been found to correlate with measures of self-deception
(Hagedorn, 1996).

Austria and Nigeria had the same level of subjective satisfaction, but Austria
scored 71 and Nigeria 30 on the Quality of Life Index. (Diener and Suh 1997a)
(pg. 19)

Clark and Oswald (1996) found that satisfaction with income had no relation to
actual income, but satisfaction was greater for those who expected
less. (pg. 20)

Unemployment affects mental health and mental health affects likelihood of
unemployment, but causation is stronger in the direction of unemployment-mental
heal. (pg. 21)

High levels of well-being increase extraversion. (Headey, Holstrom, and Wearing,
1984). (pg. 21)

## Joy and other positive emotions

People have a number of negative moods, but really only one positive mood,
joy. (pg.23)

Emotions can be plotted among two axis happy-sad and excited-calm. (pg. 24)

The intensity of positive emotions correlated with extraversion at .41 and the
intensity of negative emotions with neuroticism at .64. (pg. 26)

Thinking about and talking to others about positive events produces positive
moodes (Argyle and Martin, 1991).

Seven emotions can be reliably discrimnated by others in most cultures. (pg. 28)

Monkeys reared in isolation can recognize happy versus angry. (pg. 28)

It is an increasingly widely held view that there are a limited number of basic
emotion, perhaps seven, that have been hardwired into the brain by
evolution. (Ekman, 1982) (pg. 28)

In Japan there is a rule about not showing negative faces in public. (pg. 29)

Smiles and frowns leads to enhancement of the corresponding moods. (pg. 29)

Facial expressions may express emotions, but their real purpose may to be to
communicate with others. Facial expressions occur when people are alone, but
they are much weaker. (pg. 29)

Voice tone leaks more emotions than the face. (pg. 30)

There is no particular body posture corresponding to joy. (pg. 30)

Frequency of contact with friends, and of sexual intercourse, come out strongly
related to happiness. (Veenhoven, 1994).

The most common sources of joy (pg. 31):
* Eating
* Social activities and sex
* Exercise and sport
* Alcohol and other drugs
* Success and social approval
* Use of skills
* Music, the other arts and religion
* Weather and environment
* Rest and relaxation

Social activities and sex are the most common sources of positive
emotion. (pg. 31)

Exercise is the easiest and most powerful way of inducing positive emotion in
experimental conditions. (pg. 32)

People are in a better mood when the sun is shining, it is warm but not too
warm, and humidity is low. (Cunningham, 1979), but there is a high degree of
adaptation to the weather. (pg. 33)

Larson et al. (1984) foud that alochol produced positive emotions along all the
scales they used. (pg. 36)

## Satisfaction

Cummins (1998) concluded that most studies report an average of 70% of the
maximum of the satisfaction scale.

The effect of life satisfaction on job satisfaction is stronger than vice
versa. (Diener et al., 1999), (pg. 44)

In one study, asked if they would choose the same profession again, 91% of
mathematicians and 82% of lawyers said they would, compared wth 16% of unskilled
steel workers. (pg. 44)

Widows are about four times more likely (42% vs 10%) to be depressed than the
married. (pg. 44)

Leisure satisfaction has been found to be more related to total satisfaction
than any other domain in some studies. (pg. 45)

Watching TV is sometimes found to have a negative relationship with
satisfaction, probably because those watching TV have nothing better to
do. (pg. 45)

Adams (1997) found that objective indicators for Black Americans declined from
1980 to 1992, but life satisfaction increased. (pg. 46)

Strack et al. (1990) found that being with a handicapped confederate who seemed
to be on a kidney dialysis machine increased the well-being of real
subjects. (pg. 46)

For individuals with the same income, living in a richer or poorer area had no
effect on subjective well-being.

Schulz and Decker (1985) found, in a study of 100 disabled individuals, reported
satisfaction was lower than the general population 20 years after the
accident. (pg. 48)

The disabled are less satisfied than those who acquired their injuries at birth
or early in life. (Mehnert et al., 1990) (pg. 48)

Strack et al. (1985) found that asking subjects to think about pleasant events
in the present or recent past, but for past events there was more effect on
well-being from thinking about negative events. Past events are used to
contrast, while present events are used as evidence of well-being. (pg. 50)

## Humour and laughter

Finding things funny happens about 18 times a day, most often in spntaneous
response to situations in the presence of others. (Martin and Kuiper, 1999)
(pg. 54)

There are different kinds of jokes, but so far no agreed classification of
them. (pg. 54)

Ruch and Carrell (1998), using 263 American and 151 German adults, found very
high correlations, .80 or more, between a cheerfulness inventory and Ruch's
sense of humor scale. (pg. 54)

Extraverts laugh more. (pg. 54)

Houston et al. (1998) found that a laughter-inducing sing-song in an old
people's home led to reduced levels of anxiety and depression. (pg. 55)

It seems that only in the apes that have had a lot of human contact and been
taught sign-language can something like humor can be seen. (pg. 55)

Most adult humor contains sexual, aggressive, or hostile components. (pg. 57)

By age 6 there is a gender difference; boys tell more jokes and fool about more
than girls. (pg. 57)

The central feature of events that makes them funny is incongruity. (pg. 58)
