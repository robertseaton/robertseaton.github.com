## Terminology

I read a fair amount of the literature before realizing that there are two senses
of the word "happiness." The first is the sense of "feeling happy," happy as a
positive psychological state, an emotion, similar to joy. The other way the word
happiness is used is as "he lived a happy life." Happiness in this way is
equivalent to life satisfaction.

It is important to keep these two distinctions in mind as they are two differing
constructs. It is often completely opaque what construct a paper measures
without paying close attention to the methodology.

When psychologists write about "subjective well-being," they can mean happiness
in either or both these senses.

## Evolutionary Explanations for Positive Emotions

### The role of positive emotions in positive psychology: The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions

Given that positive emotions have been selected for by evolution, they must have
some adaptive utility. In this paper, Barbara Frederickson proposes that
positive affect facillitates the acquisition of resources. 

Positive emotions, Frederickson argues, signal that things are going well and
that energy should be invested in new pursuits. When we are happy, we tend to
invest in relationships with others, thus building up social resources. We also
become more creative and more willing to try new ways of doing thing. Our
thoughts and actions are "broadened."

Frederickson points out, as an example, the playful behavior of young animals
and how it strongly parallels adaptive behavior. Lion cubs chasing each other
looks an awful lot like pursuing prey animals and so on. 

This theory is the most widely accepted theory of the purpose positive emotions within the literature. 

## Set Point and the Hedonic Treadmill

### Lottery winners and accident victims: is happiness relative?  This is one of
the papers most misrepresented within the literature. The paper itself compares
the happiness of normal controls, lottery winners, and parapalegics.

Many authors cite the paper as suggesting that accident victims are no
less happy than lottery winners and controls. The paper actually reports that
accident victims are significantly less happier than controls and lottery
winners.

### Happiness is a stochastic phenomenon
This paper provides one of the most compelling defenses of the notion that
happiness is genetically determined. By studying twins separated at birth,
Lykken and Tellegen report that "44% to 52% of the variance in WB, however, is
associated with genetic variation." In contrast, no objective circumstance
considered by the author, such as income, marital status, or educational
attainment account for more than 3% of differences in happiness.

The author's data relies on the Well-Being scale of the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire, which does not clearly distinguish between life
satisfaction and positive affect. As such, the WB scale measures both positive
affect and life satisfaction, but not negative affect.

This paper has an oft quoted line, "It may be that trying to be happier is as
futile as trying to be taller and therefore is counterproductive." One should be
cautious, however, about arguing that it is futile to become happier on the
strength of such evidence. It is not even futile to try to become taller. [Human growth
hormone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_treatment) can increase height in individuals whose growth plates have not yet
closed, NASA reports ["astronauts living aboard the International Space Station
grow up to 3 percent taller while living in microgravity,"](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/spinal_ultrasound.html#.UecYmKC9y7I) and the average
height among Europeans has been [increasing at a rate of two centimeters per
decade](http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=348646).

### Defeatist Notions of Happiness

There is a common and maddening tendency for researchers who have not done their
homework to promote defeatist notions of happiness. They fashion themselves as
courageous truth-seekers who are free from optimistic delusions about improving
their own lot or the lot of others, at least in regards to happiness. *Flourish:
A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being* and *Happiness: A
History* are just two texts that espouse broadly similar views.

Such authors are intellectually dishonest. They back up their conclusions by
cherry picking study results to fit their conclusions and overstating the
strength of the results of those studies. I suspect that such conclusions have
more to with the author's explanatory style than with the objective truth of the
matter.

#### Is it possible to lose weight?

The medical community has no idea how to get people to lose weight. While the
biological mechanism for losing weight is well enough understood (eat fewer
calories than you burn), weight loss interventions have an abymsal track
record. The idea that it's impossible for people to lose weight, however, is not
taken seriously.

This situation strikes me as very similar to that of happiness research, except
that we're less certain about what actually makes people happier. There is
nothing as straightforward as calories-in-calories-out when it comes to
happiness, at least not yet.

I speculate that becoming happier is about as difficult as losing weight and
then maintaining the new bodyweight. While challening, it is far from
impossible. A German study found that 6% of participants experienced life satisfaction
gains in the range of 1.5 standard deviations.<a href="#citation-2"><sup>2</sup></a> In contrast, the difference
between those with spinal cord injuries and normal controls is about 0.75
standard deviations.<a href="#citation-1"><sup>1</sup></a>


### Happiness Is a Personal(ity) Thing: The Genetics of Personality and Well-Being in a Representative Sample 
This paper only ask respondents three
questions, all of which were about life satisfaction. The authors' use of the
phrase "subjective well-being," then, is somewhat misleading.

Given that money doesn't buy happiness, why are so many people obssessed with pursuing it? In this paper, Daniel Kahneman argues that the

### Education and The Quality of Life

The authors report that education, while not affecting life satisfaction
judgments, does reduce psychological and physical distress. Interestingly, women seem to
reap more of a benefit from educational attainment than men. 

The paper emphasizes the affects of education on sense of control, the
likelihood of doing nonalienating work, and a few other factors, which suggests
that interventions to increase these individual resources would likely be
effective in increasing well-being.

Unfortunately, the authors largely dismiss selection effects, such
that people with an internal locus of control or positive temperment are more
likely to invest and succeed in attaining more education.
