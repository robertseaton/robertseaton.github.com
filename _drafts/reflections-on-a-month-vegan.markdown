title: "Spinach, Unhealthy? Reflections on one month vegan"
layout: post
---

Need rhyming poem:
-- comic: I would not like green eggs and ham.
-- comic: I'm a vegan. 

August of last year, I wrote a post on [the reasoning behind certain "strange"
beliefs](http://rs.io/2013/08/26/reasoning-behind-selected-strange-beliefs.html). I covered [veganism, cryonics, existential risk, simulationism,
polyamory, and singularitarianism](http://rs.io/2013/08/26/reasoning-behind-selected-strange-beliefs.html).

Then, in September, I wrote about the curious gender imbalance among vegans --
that
[there are 3 woman-vegans for every man-vegan](http://rs.io/2013/09/25/chicks-dig-veganism.html).

If we take those as indicative of the feelings of past-me, I've been open to the
idea of veganism for about 10 months now. Sort of admiring vegans from afar,
while the ideas have percolated somewhere in the recesses of my mind, far from
the light of day.

It wasn't until exactly a month ago, though, that I received the push necessary
for dietary change.

My mother and sister are, like all women, perpetually
dieting. And my sister has recently been on a Netflix documentary spree,
with a teen-girl-level-emphasis on those about mistreated  marine
creatures. Dolphins in *The Cove* and killer whales in *Black Fish*, (both of
which I recommend, if you're into that sorta thing.)

So, right, my sister decides, well, she's going to watch *Food, Inc.* next. I told
her that, after watching it, if she wanted, I'd go vegan with her.

Not going to happen, she said.

And then I left to do something --
[maybe run](http://rs.io/2014/07/10/born-to-run-review.html). And she watched
it. And then she was like, "Okay. Let's be vegan now." And my mom
thought, hey, yeah, I'll do this, too. And my father was like,
wow-you're-so-weird-how-could-I-ever-give-up-meat, playing into the whole [women are
vegans and men aren't](http://rs.io/2013/09/25/chicks-dig-veganism.html)
cliche -- which I have a new theory about, but I'll get into that later.

## Groundwork

You know those ridiculous trigger warnings that everyone tangentially associated
with Tumblr has been prefacing their writing with? 

Maybe this post could use one, because there are a few topics that turn
people into lunatics. Like politics, and religion, and racism, and gender, and
[anything that people absorb into their identity](http://rs.io/2014/03/10/deconstruct-and-absorb.html). 

Like meat eating.

There is a *significant* subset of the male population who are really attached
to eating meat. Or think that talking about eating right is low-status. Maybe it
is. 

But I have a stronger preference for preventing heart
disease than for not-talking-about-healthy-eating.

These people should maybe not read this post.

## Definitions and whatever

A vegan is someone who refrains from consuming animal products. Here's what vegetus.org says about veganism:

> Unlike the word vegetarian, the word vegan specifically implies moral concern
> for animals, and this concern extends to all areas of life, not just diet. If
> you do not believe in animal equality, please consider referring to yourself
> as someone who doesn't eat animal products, as one who follows a plant-based
> diet, or as one who follows a vegan diet. Or, continue to educate yourself
> about veganism, and perhaps you will choose to practice veganism.

Yeah-h-h, this chick can 100% go fuck herself. 

Unless you're Humpty Dumpty,<a href="#citation-1"><sup>1</sup></a> you don't get
to put up a web page and decides what a word means. This would be as stupid as
someone deciding that atheism doesn't just mean disbelief in a God, and it
instead requires acceptance of the progressive ideology, you know, "social
justice, feminism, anti-racism, and combating homophobia and transphobia."

Oh, wait, [that already happened.](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Atheism_Plus)

There are some connotations of veganism that I'd like to throw out: the woo
around GMOs, sympathy for hippy-cluster stuff in belief space (crystal healing,
homeopathy, etc.), tattoos.

Maybe I'll start my own brand of veganism. Punk rock veganism. Where we eat
vegetables because we're mad as fuck at evolution for programming us to love
fatty, sugary, animal protein-y foods and to die of heart disease.

Or self-interested veganism, for people who eat vegan only because of
the health benefits. Ayn Rand veganism. I like the sound of that. 

Stuff like that.

## But... why?

I'm not going to delve too deep into the different benefits of veganism, because
I promised that I wouldn't try to convert readers. But there seem to be three
sort of pillars of veganism -- the major justifications for avoiding animal
products:

* Creating a sustainable planet. Meat is a very inefficient source of calories
  -- only about a quarter of the nutritional value of the grain fed to a cow is captured as meat. There's
  also a new paper out in *Climatic Change*, which found that [the dietary carbon
  footprint of vegans is about half that of meat eaters](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-014-1169-1/fulltext.html).
* Reducing animal suffering. This one is pretty straightforward. I know there
  are a lot of non-vegans out there (men, generally) who claim that they don't
  care about what happens to, say, a cow. I suspect these individuals are just
  confused about there own values, and actually would prefer a world without
  animal suffering to one with it.
* Health. *The China Study* is probably the strongest evidence that we have for
  the efficacy of a plant-based diet on preventing heart disease and all the
  other problems that come with affluence. There are a lot of people who argue
  against this by setting up some straw argument, that veganism is not a perfect
  diet -- I think this is asinine in the extreme. Not perfect? Okay: I still bet
  it's better than yours.
  
Anyways, my general feeling is that if you took two diets, veganism and whatever
your preferred diet is, and wrote down a list of pros and cons of each, veganism
would win pretty handily.

## Restrictive?

So, right, one of the, uh, concerns I hear echoed most about veganism from
people is that it's a very restrictive diet. No animal products! How can someone
live like that?

I've not found that to be the case. There was a period of about two days where I
had to get used to the fact that yes, now I'm not going to eat certain things
anymore. There was a sort of profound, alieness to it at first.

I began to think about food in a different manner, too. I mean, before, I just
had one real category for food: stuff that's edible. When I was going through
the transition, though, I had to start paying more attention to what foods
aren't animal products.

Which seems pretty basic, but it's just not something that you pay attention to
during your day-to-day life, so, yeah. It felt sorta strange at first.

But after a few days, that all went away, and eating is back to feeling
normal.

As far as restrictiveness, it's really only a problem if you want to eat out, or
go to eat at someone's place where they're non-vegan. (I'm looking at you,
[Austin](http://austingwalters.com/).) Like, if want to eat not-animal products
at McDonald's, you're limited to like apple wedges and coffee.

Really, this seems sorta messed up. Do we really need meat in every *salad*? I
don't think so.

So, eating out has been the only real difficulty in sticking with veganism. I've
"solved" this problem by basically just eating whatever I want when I'm out,
veganism be damned.

I figure I don't want to get too radical about the whole thing and, hey, what's
one marginal burger?

## Recreating meat with vegetables



## A world of questions

## Why are women vegans? The helpless man model

- Sandwiches. How does one make a vegan sandwich?
- Recreating meat with vegetables -- feels vaguely immoral. Like given a new medium (clay) with all sorts of powerful options, and using it to recreate your old drawings.
- Cheerios are maybe not 100% vegan, but why bother? If I can't eat anything that causes some social harm, I'll starve.
- Look at food differently, new categories. Instead of "stuff I'll eat, stuff I won't" start to think about stuff that's animal vs not. Sometimes a banana is not just a banana.
- Snackfood difficulty.
- General "What the hell do I eat?" feeling.
