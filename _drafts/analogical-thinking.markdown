Questions that I have:
* What does it mean to say that analogy is the core of cognition?

- a concept is a collection of things that are similar in some sense
- words are mappings between word and reality -- a collection of things
- the point of communication is to transfer one mental obect from person to person. 

- idea: picture of two people, mapping of mental construct -> words -> mental construct

* How can analogy be used to help understand phenomenon?
* Can analogy aid transfer of knowledge and skills from one domain to another?
  
- communication is about moving a construct from one mind to another

## Notes

Several studies have shown that inducing people to explicitly compare two exemplars fosters transfer to new situations (Catrambone & Holyoak, 1989; Gick & Holyoak, 1980, 1983; Kurtz et al., 2001; Reeves & Weisberg, 1990).

In this article, we investigate a technique called analogical encoding—in which learners compare two examples and by doing so come to understand the underlying structure common to both (Ferguson, 1994; Ferguson & Forbus, 1998; Loewenstein, Thomp- son, & Gentner, 1999).
