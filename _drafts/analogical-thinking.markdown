Words are not the stuff of thought.

This is straightforward to demonstrate. Present someone with a quote -- it can
be anything, but for concreteness let's say you go with a bit of Thoreau: "I was
not designed to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who
is the strongest."

So, you present this line to someone, and then you let some time pass, say an
hour, and ask them to repeat the quote back to you. What do they tell you?

I'd wager that you don't get the exact quote back, but the gist of the
thing. Sort of like when reading this, you will come away not with an exact memory of every word, every period, but instead a general idea of
what it is that I'm talking about -- a summary.

If words were the stuff of thought, or at least of memory, you'd expect that words would be
stored as, well, words. If words were the stuff of thought, when presented with
a quote, you'd repeat the exact quote back on recall.

But, instead, there seems to be some kind of mental translation that goes
on. You don't remember the exact quote but, instead, it gets
stored as a "gist," as if your mind translates it to meaningness.

So words are not the stuff of thought.

Let me put it another way. What I'm saying is that, **when you are offered some
concept in words, you store that concept as what I'll call pure meaning. And,
then, when you communicate it with someone, you translate that pure meaning back
into words.**

This explains why the quotes are not exact, but become garbled on recall -- the
words have to undergo translation: first, from words to meaningness to be
stored, and then from meaningness back into words during recall. It's like
taking English, translating it into Chinese, and then translating it back into
English.

You won't get out the original English.

## How this relates to metaphor

Now, with this in mind, let's consider the problem of
communication. To make this easier, let's consider idealized communication,
where the goal really is communication. This is different from communication "in the wild", where a lot of
talking is not about substance, but about expressing friendliness or
(perhaps unconsciously!) furthering one's agenda.

But, for the sake of this discussion, let's consider idealized communication,
where communication really is about the transfer of ideas. Given this idea of
meaningness translation, what can we say about this transfer?

Well, the goal of communication is for the speaker to translate some useful
structure he has in his mind, encoded in meaningness, and to re-encode it in
some other form -- typically language, but it could also be art, or dance, body
language, whatever.

Then, the task of the listener, is to take this language-encoded structure and
to decode it back into the original meaningness -- or, at least, some sort of
meaningness compatible with the listener's mind.

Thus, **communication is really about the transfer of useful mind structures
between speakers -- but, since we can't directly transfer from one brain to
another via an uplink ala *The Matrix*, there's an intermediate encoding
and decoding step.**

## What labels imply

Okay, let's take a step back then and consider the implications. What does it
mean when you encounter a word or a phrase that you don't understand? What does
that indicate?

If we take the encode-decode dance at face value, it's an indication that the
speaker has some useful cognitive structure in their head, with which you're
unfamiliar. So, concretely, I recently learned the word "ostensibly" which
means "as it seems on the surface, but perhaps not actually."

I have found this a very gratifying label to have in my head, after I went
through the effort of re-building the cognitive structure that it represents, because now I can say something like, "Big business is ostensibly
pro-immigration reform because they care about the welfare would-be immigrants."
And "ostensibly" here acts as a sort of a wink that says, yeah, that's the surface explanation,
but maybe there's something more to it. In this example, this something more
would be that maybe big business just cares about cheap labor.

So, what am I trying to say here? What's the practical interpretation? When you come across some equation, word, phrase, or whatever, that strikes
you as foreign, **take this as an indication that the person has some
useful cognitive structure that you don't.**

## What does this have to do with analogy

Now, in a section that is about analogical thinking, you are maybe wondering why
I've taken you through this detour into communication and cognitive structures. The idea is
that, in some sense, all language acts as a metaphor.

This notion has recently been making the rounds with the endorsement of Doug
Hofstadter, of [*Gödel, Escher, Bach*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465026567&linkCode=as2&tag=rsio-20) (very recommended) fame, but the idea is at least as
old as Lakoff and Johnson's [*Metaphors We Live By*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226468011/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226468011&linkCode=as2&tag=rsio-20) and, no doubt, older still than
that.

Here is what I mean when I say that all communication is analogy. Consider
again the encode-decode theory of communication I just told you about: it's
about taking meaningness, mapping it into words, and then unmapping it back into meaningness.

What do you call a mapping between two different things? An
analogy. So, in a sense, **all communication is about constructing an analogy
between cognitive structures and words, and then the task of the listeners is to
decode that analogy into their own mental model.**

Essentially, that's what's happening right now: I'm encoding my ideas here, as
words, and you, the reader, are decoding them. And, if everything is going as
planned, you're building a cognitive structure in your head right now which is
very similar to the one that I have in mind.

This is what separates a good exposition from a bad one: with a good
one, it's easy to decode and build up the writer's cognitive structures in your
own mind. With bad exposition, you either end up with no structure or a damaged one, a misunderstanding.

## Concepts as analogical bundles

In fact, we can go even a little further than this, and say, what is a concept,
*really*? That is, what are these cognitive structures that I have in my
mind?

As a concrete example, let's consider the number three. What is the idea of
three-ness?

Well, with the concept, if you wanted to transfer it to a young child, you'd
give concrete examples. A group of three rocks, three bananas, and so on, except
of course you wouldn't say "three" -- you would show them three rocks, three
bananas, and you'd ask them, so, what do these things have in common?

With enough examples, they would catch on, or at least so I suspect. I've been
unable to acquire the necessary funding to experiment on young children.

The idea, though, is that with any concept, when you start unbundling it, you
find that it's really just a bunch of examples with some common core --
some hidden structure, that isn't immediately obvious when you consider just one
thing in isolation, but becomes apparent with the study of concrete examples.

That is, **a concept is a bundle of concrete examples.** The process of abstraction,
of obtaining a useful cognitive structure, is ultimately one of comparing and
contrasting examples, until have built up this structure in your mind.

## Some scientific results of analogical thinking

So, let's recap for a moment:

* Communication is the process of translating a cognitive structure into words,
  and then from words back into a cognitive structure.
* This mapping and unmapping is an analogy: setting up an
  isomorphism between cognitive structures and words.
* A concept is a bundle of concrete examples. Each example contains some common
  core, with is captured in the concept. Thus, every concept is itself an
  analogy.
  
So, really, here we have two different uses of analogy: a concept/cognitive
structure is an analogy, and we use a process of analogy to transfer them
between people.

If this is really true, if I'm not just spinning you a nice story, we ought to
expect that the study of concrete examples is the best way to go about learning
a new concept. Really, it's probably the only way to really build a new
cognitive structure in your mind.

Is there any evidence to support this view? Well, yes. There's significant evidence suggesting that **comparing and contrasting examples is a powerful technique when it comes to understanding something new.**

Consider the inert knowledge problem. The inert knowledge problem is when
you're in a situation, and you have relevant, applicable knowledge, but you fail
to apply that knowledge. So, concretely, say you've taken a basic calculus
class, and you're arguing with someone about population growth. You get
in this heated disagreement. They say that our current growth is unsustainable,
and we're heading towards an inevitable collapse because there is not enough
food to go around -- a Malthusian catastrophe.

You take a contrary position, and point out that, as nations develop, birth
rates fall, such that population growth is below the replacement rate in some
developed nations, like Japan and Germany. At a certain tipping point of prospertiy, population plateaus
and then actually begins to fall.

If your calculus knowledge transferred, here you might realize that this
is an argument about the shape of the derivative of population
growth. And, if you so realized, you might both draw out curves of what you
think it looks like, and then compare that to empirical data.

The inert knowledge problem would be 1) knowing calculus 2) having this
argument and 3) not realizing that you're actually arguing about derivatives.

Now, depending on the amount of learning you've done in the past, you may or may not have noticed
that inert knowledge is the devil. Why learn something if you fail to
apply it? What can be done about this?

Well, okay, learning something is about the acquisition of concepts, right? So
calculus knowledge is about building up calculus structures in your
head.

If, as I've argued, this is the case, we might expect that comparing and
contrasting examples (and thusly promoting concept acquisition) would help us
overcome the inert knowledge problem.

Is this the case? Yes. **There's even some evience that comparing and
contrasting examples, "analogical encoding", is potentially the only effective
technique at dealing with this inert knowledge plague.** One review put it this
way: "The best-established way of promoting relational transfer is for the
learner to compare analogous examples during learning (Catrambone & Holyoak,
1989; Gentner, Loewenstein, & Thompson, 2003; Gick & Holyoak, 1983; Reeves &
Weisberg, 1994; Ross & Kennedy, 1990; Seifert et al., 1986, Experiments 1 and
2)."

This goes even a little further, and the quoted study further finds
that analogical encoding (comparing and contrasting examples) not only promotes
future transfer, but actually works backward in time.

What do I mean by this? I mean that, if you sit down and compare and contrast
examples, you're going to be much more effective at coming up with past,
relevant experiences of the principle in question. You can use this to transform inert knowledge into animated knowledge.

To use our calculus example again, if you're reading about the
jerk in calculus (the rate of change in acceleration), and you comapre and
contrast real-world examples, you're more likely to spontaneously realize that,
when learning to drive, the jerk you felt when stopping too quickly was an
example of the jerk in physics.

## Benefits for the acquistion of expertise

So, at this point, I hope you're convinced that comparing and contrasting
examples is *the* way to go about acquiring a new concept -- it's how to
absorb a bundle of concrete examples and distill them into a useful cognitive
structure.

But that's not all! This is not the only benefit. Consider what it means to be an expert
at something. One of the most cited studies on expertise compared how graduate
students in physics categorized physics problems, versus how novices did.

The finding? Physics experts were more likely to pick out the underlying
physical principle, while novices tended to focus on irrelevant surface
characteristics. Presumably, physics experts had built up a cognitive structure
that they recognized in the problem. The novices, lacking this mental structure, were unable to spot it.

If the theory I have sketched here is correct, then we ought to expect that
**comparing and contrasting examples will accelerate the acquisition of concepts
and therefore expertise**. Analogical encoding allows one to swim out from shallow
seas and into the depths -- "comparison between two
analogous examples acts to make their common relational structure more salient
(Gentner & Medina, 1998; Gentner & Namy, 1999; Markman & Gentner, 1993)."

## Practical implications

Okay, then, we've just breezed through the core ideas of analogical thinking. To
sum it up:

* Words are not the stuff of thought. Our minds translate words into something
  else (meaningness).
* Communication is essentially about analogy: it's about mapping a cognitive
  structure ("meaningness") into words, and then the listener unpacks that back
  into a cognitive structure.
* Thus, sucessful communication is about setting up understandable
  analogies.
  
Then, I covered the relationship between concepts and analogy:

* A concept is a bundle of concrete examples with that illustrates
  some core relationship between those examples. The concept of three-ness can
  be understood as the relation between concrete instances of three things
  (bananas, rocks, years).
* Given that a concept is a bundle of examples, we should expect that the
  best way to acquire a useful cognitive structure is to compare and contrast
  examples ("analogical encoding").
* There is a significant body of evidence that suggests that this is the case:
  comparing and contrasting examples is a powerful way to acquire a concept.
  
I also touched on the inert knowledge problem, and how analogical encoding
allows us to overcome it:

* The inert knowledge problem is when you have relevant knowledge but fail to
  take advantage of it. Example: failing to realize that an argument about
  population growth is an argument about the shape of a derivative.
* The only consistely supported method of overcoming the inert knowledge problem,
  and promoting the application of a concept in new situations ("transfer"), is analogical
  encoding -- by comparing and contrasting examples. "When subjects explicitly compared the analogs and then immediately attempted to solve the target problem in the context of a single experiment, transfer was obtained with significant frequency even without a hint that the analogs and target were related. (Holyoak and Catrambone)"
  
Finally, I mentioned how this relates to expertise:

* Experts are distinguished by better developed cognitive structures. Physics
  experts, for example, are able to pick up on the underlying structure of
  physics problem, while novices focus on sufrace characteristics.
* How can we acquire such a cognitive structure? By analogical encoding --
  comparing and contrasting examples. Contrasting examples fosters a focus on deeper structures.
* Thus, to accelerate the acquisition of expertise, one should take advantage of
  analogical encoding.
  
So, practically speaking, how can you, as an individual put this into practice?
This method, analogical encoding, is both simple and powerful. **To acquire a new
cognitive structure, gather together a bunch of examples of the concept, and
then compare and contrast those examples.**

If you would like to improve your calculus skill, you
should Google for real-world examples of derivatives or integrals or any concept
that you'd like to acquire. Then, write them down, and then list how each is
similar and each is different.

You can also use these principles to improve your communication and teaching skills. If you want someone to obtain a cognitive structure that you have, illustrate the principle with examples, and then bring their attention to the underlying similarity connecting the examples. In the case of this section, the principle behind all of these examples has been that learning and communication is about the transfer of concepts, which are bundles of examples, and can be acquired by contrasting concrete examples.

Now, what was that Thoreau quote, again?
