Questions that I have:
* What does it mean to say that analogy is the core of cognition?

- a concept is a collection of things that are similar in some sense
- words are mappings between word and reality -- a collection of things
- the point of communication is to transfer one mental obect from person to person. 

- idea: picture of two people, mapping of mental construct -> words -> mental construct

* How can analogy be used to help understand phenomenon?
* Can analogy aid transfer of knowledge and skills from one domain to another?
  
- communication is about moving a construct from one mind to another

## Notes

### Reviving Inert Knowledge: Analogical Abstraction Supports Relational Retrieval of Past Events

Executive summary: The inert knowledge problem is the problem of being in a situation where one has relevant knowledge that would be useful, but then fails to retreive. For instance, knowing what a derivative or an integral is, but not being able to recognize the applicability of either concept in a discussion about population growth.

What can be done about this? The paper tests the technique of "analogical encoding." Analogical encoding is the act of comparing and contrasting two examples that both illustrate some more abstract concept.

The study (which describes 5 experiments) finds two things. First, analogical encoding does improve transfer in future situations. So, to extend the calculus example, if a student compares and contrasts examples of real-world calculus applications, she'll be more likely to recognize when its applicable in real life. This is not a new finding: "The best-established way of promoting relational transfer is for the learner to compare analogous examples during learning (Catrambone & Holyoak, 1989; Gentner, Loewenstein, & Thompson, 2003; Gick & Holyoak, 1983; Reeves & Weisberg, 1994; Ross & Kennedy, 1990; Seifert et al., 1986, Experiments 1 and 2)."

The second, novel finding is that analogical encoding also improves the transfer of so-called inert knowledge. Back to the calculus example, if a student compares and contrasts example applications of calculus, she'll not only recognize relevant future examples, *but also improve the retrieval of past experiences demonstrating the principle.* Thus, she might realize that past discussions about population growth and Mathulsian catastophes were really arguments about the projected derivative of population change. (Although note that in all the experiments, participants were given both examples and instructions.)

Further, one of the demonstrated characteristics of experts (aka that physics problem study) is their tendency to grasp the deep structure of a problem, and not focus on surface similarities. Given that "comparison between two analogous examples acts to make their common relational structure more salient (Gentner & Medina, 1998; Gentner & Namy, 1999; Markman & Gentner, 1993)", comparing examples might be a fast track to greater expertise.

So, the obvious take-away message is that, when studying any subject, one should compile a stack of examples of any concept, and then compare and contrast them. This will substantially improve the probability that one will recognize and successfully apply the concept in the future. Further, there is some reason to believe that such a strategy will increase the rate at which one gains expertise. 



Several studies have shown that inducing people to explicitly compare two exemplars fosters transfer to new situations (Catrambone & Holyoak, 1989; Gick & Holyoak, 1980, 1983; Kurtz et al., 2001; Reeves & Weisberg, 1990).

In this article, we investigate a technique called analogical encoding—in which learners compare two examples and by doing so come to understand the underlying structure common to both (Ferguson, 1994; Ferguson & Forbus, 1998; Loewenstein, Thomp- son, & Gentner, 1999).

In contrast, the experiments in Part II demonstrated that if two prior analogs were given, subjects often derived a problem schema as an incidental product of describing the similarities of the analogs. The quality of the induced schema was highly predictive of subsequent transfer performance. Schema induction and analogical transfer

When subjects explicitly compared the analogs and then immediately attempted to solve the target problem in the context of a single experiment, transfer was obtained with significant frequency even without a hint that the analogs and target were related. (Holyoak and Catrambone)
