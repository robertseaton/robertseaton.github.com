Let's say, for the sake of discussion, that you, the gentle reader, are a good, virtuous human being. And this implies that, as a good, virtuous human being, you don't stock up on trashy, vampire-themed romance novels or the male-equivalent, science fiction and horror. (Two genres to which I owe a troubling portion of my youth.)

No. As a kind and decent reader, you consume a steady diet of textbooks. Or, at least, it's an ideal we can all aspire to.

So, being fair, humble, textbook reading folk, you have a dilemma: what's the best way to maximize the amount of knowledge that you suck out of something that you read? How can you, like the proverbial vampire, drain your victim and thusly replenish your own life-essence?

With the aim of teaching: "There is compelling evidence that when students read with the intention of learning the material as well as they can, they learn less than students instructed to learn the material so that they can teach it to someone else (Bargh & Schul, 1980)."
