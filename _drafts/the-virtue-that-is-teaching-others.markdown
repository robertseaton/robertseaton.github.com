title: Teaching Others

Let's say, for the sake of discussion, that you, the gentle reader, are a good, virtuous human being. And this implies that, as a good, virtuous human being, you don't stock up on trashy, vampire-themed romance novels or the male-equivalent, science fiction and horror. (Two genres to which I owe a troubling portion of my youth. Science fiction and horror, that is. Not vampire romance. Okay, maybe a little vampire romance.)

No. As a kind and decent reader, you consume a steady diet of textbooks. 

So, being fair, humble, textbook reading folk, you have a dilemma: what's the best way to maximize the amount of knowledge that you suck out of something that you read? How can you, like the proverbial vampire, drain your victim and thusly replenish your own life-essence?

Let's say I narrow the search space down for you. Which is going to have better results?

* Reading with the aim of maximizing your own personal knowledge, like you might to pass a test.
* Reading with the goal of teaching the material to someone else.

You can probably guess that the second option is the one I want to talk about -- not because you know that's going to be the answer, but because you have a heuristic that goes something like, "The author doesn't tell me obvious things that everyone already knows." So don't get too cocky here, buddy. If I'd started this section with, "The best way to learn something is to pretend that you're going to have to pass a test on it in the future," you'd have swallowed that like a big dumb fish.

So, concretely, when you go to learn something, learn with the intention of teaching it to someone else. This doesn't have to be a real person, or a person at all. You'll reap almost all of the benefits by learning, say, the capital asset pricing model with the intention of teaching it to your dog. I mean, dogs are at least more interactive than rubber ducks, and I guess you can interpret barks as, "Explain, please. I'm lost."

An actual person is better still -- this is one of the main motivations for my writing. It's an exercise in clarifying and solidfying my own thoughts, and as a pretty excellent bonus, I also create something of value.

In fact, one study even found participants who read something and then taught it to others outperformed those who read something and then went over it with a tutor.

Let that sink in for a moment. You know how everyone is paying many thousands of dollars a year to go to a college, at least some of them to "get an education"? Yeah, you, right here and now, could better master the same material by checking out a textbook from the library, reading a chapter, and then trying to teach it to anyone you can convince to listen.

For a cost of zero.

Let me put this another way: at the time of this writing, the median cost for one year of college is about 15 thousand dollars, and most students are taking 5 or more years to graduate, for a price tag (not counting opportunity costs) of more than 75,000 dollars. I've just taught you a simple, portable method that will achieve better cognitive results (assuming a sufficiently motivated reader), and can be implemented for the cost of a library card.

Even if we are very cynical and say that the education part of college is only 2% of the value of a degree, that piece of info I just gave you is still worth 1500 dollars.

So, I guess what I'm saying is: you're welcome.

## The Feynman method

Scott Young has a technique that captures this nicely, which he's dubbed "the Feynman technique." This is better than what I came up with: the-harass-your-girlfriend-into-listening-to-you-talk-about-the-Famaâ€“French-three-factor-model-technique. A mouthful, to be sure.

Here's how it works:
1. Read a chapter (or watch a video, etc).
2. Write down an explanation, like you're explaining it to someone else. (I typically like to use past-me as a model.)
3. When you're uncertain about something, go back to the textbook.

This techinque, my friend, is a thing of beauty. It has strong empirical support: I've just mentioned research that says teaching someone leads to greater learning and, as you're about to see, the art of memory is really the art of recall.

Keep reading.
