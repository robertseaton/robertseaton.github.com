Lend me your imagination for a minute.

One day, you're cleaning your attic. Light filters in through some crooked
blinds. It highlights the (significant) dust in the air, and you can make out
each speck, like a tiny alien race, come to colonize your attic. 

It's hot. You wonder why you volunteered for this project in the first place.

You're emptying a chest of drawers and you stumble across... well, it's what
looks like a glass sphere -- sorta a snow globe, but sans base.

It has to be old, given the amount of grime that it's accumulated. The muck
coats your fingers. Your nose curls and you grimace in a moment of disgust, and then you grab a
towel -- first each finger, and then you polish off the mutant snow
globe.

And, as it starts to gleam, your attention latches onto the tiny glass planet,
until, with a start, you realize that you can't feel your body. It's like your
consciousness has been possessed, and you can't steal your eyes away from the
ball.

Bit by bit, the attic around you disappears like television static, and you find your awareness floating,
bodyless, over a boy hunched over a math problem set and a sheet of paper. He
grips a pencil and, by his side, there lies the nub of what used to be a meaty
eraser.

As he flips through the back of the calculus book, the look of concentration on
his face is replaced with one of expectation. He lands on a page. 

His fist strikes the table.

There's a frustrated bellow-grunt, and you hear him say, "I'm too stupid. I'll
never get this."

You, too, are swept away in a moment of shared frustration, as your mind is
doubly hijacked: first by the snow globe, and now by empathy.

You wonder why the ball has sent you here, to this particular time and place,
and then...

## What's in a skill? 

Here's something I dislike: when people describe something as algorithmic as an
insult. Oh, *that*, psh, it's so algorithmic. A computer could do that.

Like when colleges tout that oh, well, we have humans review each child's
application, unlike some other places, who just let an emotionless computer do
it.

When you look at the empirical data, it's very, very tough to find a
situation where a human's predictive ability beats out a computer. 

This is well-documented in Robyn Dawes's landmark paper, "The robust beauty of
improper linear models in decision making." The gist of the paper? Basically,
even ghetto,
if-they-were-FDA-regulated-only-Chinese-citizens-would-be-allowed-to-buy-them
models outperform human.

This paper could be considered the precursor to Tetlock's magnum opus, Expert
Political Judgment, which found that quantitative models outperform, you know,
everyone.

This is illustrated in the book's most famous graphic, reproduced below, where
statistical models wrek the human and chimpanzee competiton.

But, right, I'm getting a little carried away here. The point I'm trying to make
is that *algorithms rule*. And, like I've argued before, everything can be
described as an algorithm. The entire scientific enterprise can be described as
algorithm-hunting.

The question, "How does the mind work?" is really looking for a step-by-step
process that the mind goes through to accomplish something -- when you can write
something down in such a way that a program can do, that's when you've
understood it.

If every process can be conceptualized as an algorithm, then, skills must fall
under that umbrella -- a skill is an algorithm, or as the quote at the intro
puts it, "A person taking a test or playing a piece of music is executing a
program, a deterministic procedure."

What are errors, then? Nothing but bugs in your program.
