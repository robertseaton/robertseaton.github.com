**Summary:** *I explain why scientific replication matters.*

We know what is true based on evidence. The more evidence for some belief, the
more confident in that belief you ought to be. 

This is where replication comes in. If you have one study that says something,
this is not all that much evidence that this something is true. After all,
parapsychology keeps churning out results, and
[we all know that is bullshit](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Parapsychology). 

But, if a study has been replicated, this is at least twice as much evidence
that something is true. The more replications, the more evidence, the more
likely something is true.

Given that
[most published findings are false](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124),
I no longer pay too much attention to a study before it's been replicated and,
when I do find out something surprising, you better believe I'm searching Google
Scholar for replications.
