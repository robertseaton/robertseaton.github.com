There's a [link on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1uegst/til_the_nypd_once_stripsearched_a_black_man/) to the sort of story that the internet can't get enough
of: police abuse. This time,
[the NYPD sodomizing a black man with a plunger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abner_Louima). 

People love to hear about the abuse of power. Something along the lines
of it keying into our gossip reward centers with a side of moralizing. To
indulge in creating my own evo-psych [just-so story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story): gossiping about the misdeeds of your hated
rival, head-chimp Heephop, might be a way of polling public sentiment as to your
chances at a successful coup. Disrupt the existing peace, topple the power
structure and, hey, maybe now you're on top. Or at least higher up. 

But I digress. I want to bring your attention to the top comment, which is:
> That is the reason I like the idea of all cops having to wear GoPros strapped to their chest.

To which another user responded (also highly voted):
> Honest cops should be in favor of this too, because citizen complaints also

The argument, then, is something like, "Police should be recorded because of all
the abuse it will prevent. If you need to know what really happened, you can
look at the recording." Or, to lead you to the point of this post, surveillance
of the police is an a-okay subset of surveillance more generally.

But these same arguments apply to recording everything! Want to stop people from
murdering other people? (Yes.) Record everything, everyone, everywhere. If you
need to know who murdered whom, or verify an alibi, go look it up in the archive.

At this point, the discussion we ought to be having is *how can
surveillance be implemented effectively*. People worry, rightly, that the recent
NSA revelations and that sort of thing are symptomatic of expanding executive
power, which enables abuse. The question should not be how can we reverse
surveillance, one might as profitably ask how to reverse the spinning of the
earth on its axis. Instead, we should be thinking about questions like, "How
ought surveillance be implemented? What sort of power structures are best?"
