In the book that I've been writing on keeping up in the information age
([subscribe via email](http://eepurl.com/Ufpgr) to receive a copy when it's finished), I've touched on both
Sturgeon's Law ("90% of everything is crap") and the Pareto principle, as part
of a section on filtering information. But I needed a good example. So here we are.

The main idea behind the Pareto principle, sometimes called the 80-20 rule, is
that 80% of the effect of something comes from 20% of the cause. Or more
broadly, it's the principle of the "vital few and trivial many." A few things
make most of the difference.

Oh, and, by the way, if this is the first time you've been exposed to this
concept, the amount of value you'll get out of having it in your cognitive toolkit is,
well, to quote the Beastie Boys, "it's wack," yo. I suspect the Pareto principle
obeys the Pareto principle -- that is, you can get 80% cognitive value
out of 20% of concepts, and the Pareto principle is one of those 20%.

So, consider
dating, for instance. (Relevant given the continued popularity of my earlier post on
[prolonged eye contact](http://rs.io/2014/06/01/prolonged-eye-contact.html).)

When it comes to dating, considering the Pareto principle, we should expect that 80%
of the value of all dating advice, techniques, etc. can be had from only 20% of
the tips. And I think this is true. **In fact, I'm pretty confident that all
dating wisdom can be boiled down to six words: approach more of the opposite sex**, or maybe just two: approach more.

(In fact, I think you could model relationships satisfactorily via
[Markov processes](http://austingwalters.com/introduction-to-markov-processes/),
but that's a separate post.)

## Real Examples of the Pareto Principle

So, okay, right, now you know what the Pareto principle is all about, which
brings me to my main motivation for writing this, which is: what's a cool
empirical example of the Pareto principle in action? The dating example is okay,
but it's also more-or-less fabricated from whatever imagination is made out
of.

Empirical is perhaps the wrong word. What we want are examples with rigor. Maybe we actually live in
some bizarre world where there's a 1:1 correspondence between the value you get out of dating advice and the amount you read, such that 80% of the
advice gives 80% of the value.

Or maybe we live in a world where the more you know about dating, the more
valuable the next piece you learn becomes -- since you have more context or
something. In that case, the last 20% might be worth 80% of the value, via some
clearly Satanic reverse Pareto principle. 

So, real examples. 

* Wikipedia [would have you believe](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) that the Pareto principle was born during
Vilfredo Pareto's study of **Italian landowners -- 20% of them owned 80% of the
land.**

* The article alternatively suggest that it stemmed out of the
study of pea pods -- that Pareto noticed **20% of the pea pods in his garden
produced 80% of the peas.**

Which of these is true? Probably neither.

Looking past this deep seated and shocking inequality in the pea kingdom, the
reality of the discovery of the Pareto principle is not so clear cut. The
principle itself was not so much the discovery of Pareto, but Joseph Juran, who
repurposed some of Pareto's ideas. He writes about this in a 1975 paper, ["The non-Pareto principle; mea
culpa"](http://img.projectsmart.co.uk/docs/the-non-pareto-principle.pdf):

More examples:

* He recounts, in the same paper, that he first noticed the idea when working on
quality control as a young engineer: **20% of reported defects accounted for 80% of
the defectiveness.**
* This finding is echoed by a 2002 report from Microsoft, which
reports that ["**80 percent of the errors and crashes in Windows and Office are caused
by 20 percent of the entire pool of bugs detected.**"](http://www.crn.com/news/security/18821726/microsofts-ceo-80-20-rule-applies-to-bugs-not-just-features.htm)

* Another still-pretty-prosaic example comes from world GDP numbers, with [**20% of
the world's population controlling 82.7% of the world's income**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#In_economics). 
* A 1997 book,
[*The Book Publishing Industry*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415887240/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0415887240&linkCode=as2&tag=rsio-20&linkId=W2CSH7FH422CHBHQ),
similarly observes that **the bulk of book sales come a few authors.**
* I suspect
books are more imbalanced than 80/20. In film, for instance, [**80% of box office
revenue goes to just 1.3% of all movies**](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/chaos-theory-explodes-hollywood-hype-1275802.html). 

* Another book, [*The 80/20 Principle*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385491743/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385491743&linkCode=as2&tag=rsio-20&linkId=AJUYPEXQRXYSHI7A), gives the example of carpet wear: **20% of
carpet receives 80% of the wear** but, like most Pareto examples, this one seems
made up. 
* Similarly, the book reports that, **in a 20 block area in Philadelphia in 1931,
70% of all marriages occurred between people who lived within 30% of the
distance.** 
* Indeed, the law seems to apply to the internet as well, with [one paper](http://shell.cas.usf.edu/~simon/documents/Network%20Theory.pdf) reporting
that **80% of links go to 20% of web pages.** (Although, somewhat troublingly,
the paper provides no source.)
* Actually, looking at the traffic and analytics for this website, **the top 1.7% of
pages -- namely, the [list of cool data sets](http://rs.io/2014/05/29/list-of-data-sets.html), [the science of problem solving](http://rs.io/2014/02/21/problem-solving.html), and
the post on [prolonged eye contact](http://rs.io/2014/06/01/prolonged-eye-contact.html) -- account for 82% of page views**.

Which makes me wonder: could you get 80% of the value of this article by reading
20% of the words?
