<p>Lips move and sound happens, <br /> Words come together, sentences form, <br /> But communication never occurs, <br /> Nothing transfers. <br /></p>

<p>One party to another: <br /> Talking, waving, motioning, <br /> Eyes wide, mouth agape, <br /> Ears closed. <br /></p>

<p>Want connection? Meet rejection! <br /> No true things are ever spoken. <br /> Feel some feelings, don&#8217;t try sharing, <br /> Talk about the things you&#8217;re wearing. <br /></p>

<p>A whisper, scream, or in between, <br /> If what you&#8217;re saying: <em>it&#8217;s important!</em> <br /> Just remember, they&#8217;re only playing &#8211; <br /> an expected part, one they&#8217;re portraying. <br /></p>
