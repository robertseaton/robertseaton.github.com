<p>A problem&#8217;s importance is determined by the amount of good that work on it produces.</p>

<p>The essence of &#8220;what is good&#8221; is the extent to which something reduces suffering and increases happiness. This is not to claim that these are the sole factors that determine goodness, but rather that any theory of the good would be incomplete without them and that they compose the core components of most theories of the good.</p>

<p>You can do good in countless ways: curing a disease, feeding the hungry, telling a cashier a joke, or praising friend&#8217;s sense of style.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s better to save two lives than it is to save one life. The more people that work on a problem helps, the more good that work does and, consequently, the more important that work is.</p>

<h2 id='hard_problems'>Hard Problems</h2>

<p>Work on impossible problems is not important. It will not lead anywhere. The human condition will not be improved. The more likely it is that work on a problem will do a lot of good, the more important that problem is. It is better to work on something where you have a 95% chance of saving a million lives than it is to work on something where you have a 5% chance of saving a million lives.</p>

<p>It is not good to work on something hard just because it is hard. Working on something hard is not in and of itself virtuous. Most of the people working on research in pure mathematics are working on hard problems. Given how disconnected pure mathematics is from reality, just donating some spare money to a charity is probably more important than work on TK important math problem divorced from reality.</p>

<p>At this point, I imagine some smart-ass reader thinking, &#8220;Yeah, but sometimes pure mathematics does have important real world consequences.&#8221; I agree. This is not a real objection, though. We are again talking about the liklihood of doing a lot of good.</p>

<p>One could argue, for example, that there is a chance you might have some kind of powerful insight into many of the world&#8217;s greatest ills by becoming a world chess grandmaster. The chance is neglibible. You would be better served by direct work on solving the problem.</p>

<p>It is important to take in account context when deciding whether or not to work on a problem. Consider two scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Curing a rare disease that will save 20 lives per year. Discovering the cure is an active area of inquiry within your discipline and there is a 90% chance that someone will discover a cure within the next year regardless of your contribution.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Curing a rare disease that will save 5 lives per year. The disease is absent from the academic literature and most researchers have no idea that it exists. Those that do know of its existence are not interested in finding a cure. There is less than a 1% chance that someone will discover a cure within the next year without your contribution.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You should work on the second problem.</p>

<p>This has an odd implication. Most people believe that Isaac Newton&#8217;s invention of calculus and Alexander Graham Bell&#8217;s invention of the telephone were extremely important. However, all of these were discovered independently by other people: Leibniz (among others) discovered the calculus at the same time as Newton, Elisha Gray filed a patent for the invention of the telephone on the same day as Alexander Graham Bell. The infamous formula E=mc^2 TK fix in one form or another was chanced upon by Henri Poincar√©, Olinto De Pretto, Paul Langevin and, of course, Albert Einstein.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s useful here to make a distinction. I&#8217;m not saying that the discovery of caclulus or the invention of the telephone were not important. Rather, my point is that the individual work of Alexander Graham Bell and Isaac Newton was less important than it first appears. The world may have been better off if they had invested energy in some other pursuit.</p>

<p>Our aim should be an efficient distribution of intellectual resources among problems so that we maximize the amount of good accomplished. One aspect of reducing waste is to prevent duplicated work, such as two people inventing the telephone. By taking into account the amount of work that other people are doing on a problem before we begin working on it, we can maximize the amount of difference we make as an individual.</p>

<p>Doing important work doesn&#8217;t always feel important and is often not recognized as such. Important work is distinct from recognition for doing important work. When we think of doing groundbreaking research, we think of Albert Einstein and how great it would be to be like him.</p>

<p>This is a focusing illusion. We only hear about important work when it has been recognized. Important work without recognition is effectively invisible. We have no memory of it because we&#8217;ve never heard of it. There may have been tens of thousands of important discoveries that have been ignored.</p>

<p>A significant amount of the appeal of doing important work is connected to the social status that we expect to gain as a result of doing that work. In this sense, then, aspirations of being a great researcher are often not much different from dreams of being rich and famous. Our monkey brains want desperately to maximize their reproductive fitness.</p>

<p>The model I have presented here is not about maximizing reproductive fitness. If that is your goal, you would be better served by donating to a sperm bank or studying seduction than by setting out to do important work. This model is concerned with doing important work regardless of whether or not one achieves recognition for it.</p>

<p>You might ask yourself, for example, would you be content with improving the world even if someone else received credit for it? If the answer is yes, then you are probably interested in defining important work as I&#8217;ve presented here. If not, you are interested in something else and ought to be focusing on that goal directly instead.</p>
