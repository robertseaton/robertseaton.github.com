<span id='quote-attribute'>Derek Parfit, <em>On What Matters</em></span>
<p>We all have an intuitive sense of how important different issues are. When the local news reported that the Illinois Congress <a href='http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/27/illinois-puppy-lemon-law/2364179/'>passed a puppy lemon law</a>, I asked myself, &#8220;Puppies? Are you fucking serious? What about unemployment? What about the homeless?&#8221;</p>

<p>All of us operate under the assumption that some issues are more important than others. Even the staunchest post-modernist lives his life in a way that suggests he believes some matters are more pressing than others. Jay Leno loves to lampoon pointless research on <em>The Tonight Show</em>, usually justifiably so. There is even a <a href='http://www.improbable.com/ig/'>satirical nobel prize awarded to strange or trivial research</a>.</p>

<p>What makes something important, then? How do we identify important problems? How do we decide what to work on? Given a choice, we&#8217;d all prefer to do something important. Would you rather cure cancer or fold t-shirts at the local strip mall? No one wants to waste their life on the trivial. We want purpose. We want to do meaningful work.</p>

<p>What about curing cancer makes it so important? The most salient is this: cancer has a huge impact on many lives. According to the CDC, <a href='http://www.cdc.gov/features/worldcancerday/'>cancer kills 7.6 million people each year</a>. Cancer is a major component of global suffering.</p>

<p>Further, the horrors of cancer are available in the minds of all of us. Everyone has been exposed to it via the death of a loved one, seeing it in the media, or hearing about it from a friend.</p>

<p>Compare this to something like working on Wall Street. A <a href='http://www.gallup.com/poll/149216/americans-rate-computer-industry-best-federal-gov-worst.aspx'>recent Gallup poll</a> revealed banking as one of America&#8217;s most hated industries. Why do people hate banking? Because bankers don&#8217;t seem to create much value for society. They control a disproportionate amount of wealth for how much positive impact they have on the world.</p>

<p>My friends and family often express outrage at the salaries of some professions. CEOs, professional athletes, and coaches are most often the targets of their incredulity. Why does this bother them? They don&#8217;t feel that it&#8217;s fair that these people make so much money for what they do. Do athletes improve the world? To some extent, yes, but many people are getting paid far less for doing much more. The value of great humanitarians is not reflected in their salaries.</p>

<p>Take folding clothes at the mall as another example. It&#8217;s not recognized as an important job. Why not? Because it doesn&#8217;t have a significant impact on any of our lives. Folded clothes at the mall just don&#8217;t matter. No one is better off.</p>

<h2 id='impact'>Impact</h2>

<p>Some things we recognize as important because they have wide-ranging consequences for a lot of people. The invention of the atomic bomb changed the world, as did the automobile, the telephone, the lightbulb, and the internet.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of important work is that it improves the human condition. Affecting a lot of people is not sufficient for importance. Imagine a scientist that manages to change the sky purple. Nothing negative or positive results from this beyond the fact that, now, when people look up on a clear day, they see a purple sky.</p>

<p>Is this important work? No. We can imagine a similar scenario where an advertising campaign familiarizes everyone with a product and that&#8217;s all. Just because a lot of people might be affected, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s important or worthwhile. Indeed, a lot of advertising strikes me as downright evil. Manufacturing new insecurities or otherwise intensifying existing ones to sell a product is an attack on individual well-being.</p>

<h2 id='where_our_intuitions_break_down'>Where Our Intuitions Break Down</h2>

<p>Our intuitions about what matters are the crude products of evolution. Our species did not evolve to deal with problems of the scope and quality that we currently face. We&#8217;re adapted for <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number#Research_background'>communities of between fifty and two hundred individuals</a>, not a global community of billions.</p>

<p>Humans suck at dealing with large numbers or subtle degrees. Consider a scientist who devises a cure for a rare, but lethal, disease that affects about five people each year. Most people would consider that very important work. After all, he is saving lives.</p>

<p>Now, consider someone who works in finance and makes several hundred thousand dollars each year, but who donates $20,000 each year to <a href='http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities'>GiveWell&#8217;s top rated charity</a>.</p>

<p>Who is doing more important work? I&#8217;d wager that most of people would say that the scientist curing a deadly disease is doing something more important than the investment banker, but by donating $20,000 dollars to an effective charity each year, the investment banker is saving 3.7 more lives than the scientist.</p>

<p>Now whose work is more important?</p>

<h3 id='guns_and_tobacco'>Guns and Tobacco</h3>

<p>Which is a bigger problem: gun-related deaths or tobacco-related deaths? Judging by the amount of media attention gun control receives, gun deaths are the more important problem.</p>

<p>In a way, this makes sense. After all, if someone who understands the risks that they&#8217;re taking on by lighting up a cigarette and does it anyways, their death is their own fault. There&#8217;s no one to blame. How could this be bad? It&#8217;s worse if someone has their life taken from them through no fault of their own.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to consider gun deaths worse than tobacco-deaths, even if, as a society, we place way too much emphasize on what&#8217;s fair, especially considering that such evaluations are <em>always</em> biased by self-interest (INSERT CITATION).</p>

<p>Consider, however, that about <a href='http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm'>30,000 Americans die each year from gun-related causes</a>, of which <a href='http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm'>2/3rds are suicides</a> Contrast this with 443,000 <a href='http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/'>tobacco-related deaths each year</a>, of which 49,400 are due to second-hand smoke.</p>

<p>Now which is worse?</p>

<h3 id='a_life_is_a_life_is_a_life'>A Life is a Life is a Life</h3>

<p>Are all lives created equal? While most of us <em>pay lip service to the idea</em>, we act otherwise. We spend more time helping our local community and pay little attention to what&#8217;s happening in the rest of the world. As a nation, we&#8217;ve invested <a href='http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2008/04/AP_COST/EN/'>huge amounts of money in a fight against terrorism</a>, while <a href='http://www.bread.org/hunger/global/'>millions die of poverty related causes each year</a>.</p>

<p>Some deaths have more impact on the world than others, however and, in that respect, it does make sense to consider some lives as more important than others. None of us are outraged that the president receives secret service protection while we don&#8217;t.</p>

<blockquote>

<span id='quote-attribute'>Christopher Hitchens, *The Quotable Hitchens from Alcohol to Zionism: The Very Best of Christopher Hitchens</span>
<p>Given enough time, every discussion of international politics is bound to elicit something along the lines of: &#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t be getting involved in the Middle East. We should mind our own business and worry about problems at home.&#8221; The assumption behind these statements is that local issues are more important than those in other countries. There is near universal endorsement of the idea that we have a greater obligation to help those <em>near and dear</em> to us than to help strangers.</p>

<p>Let us assume that it is better to save an American life than it is to save someone in Africa. According to GiveWell, the <a href='http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas'>most efficient U.S. charities need $10,000 dollars to improve a child&#8217;s academic performance and reduce academic performance</a>. Note that this isn&#8217;t even saving a life.</p>

<p>In contrast, it costs about $2300 to save a life in Africa by giving to the <a href='http://www.againstmalaria.com/'>Against Malaria Foundation</a>. We have a choice then: save four lives in Africa or improve the academic and prosocial performance of one child in the United States.</p>

<p>It might help to further expand on this choice. How many children&#8217;s lives would you need to improve in order for that to be the equivalent of saving one life? This isn&#8217;t an easy question to answer, especially if you&#8217;re not used to making such comparisons. There isn&#8217;t any &#8220;right&#8221; answer. It hinges on personal judgment.</p>

<p>You need to ask yourself: at what point am I indifferent between improving the lives of X children and saving one life? Remember, we&#8217;re only considering citizens of your own nation here. I would be indifferent at around 30 children. I figure one life saved is worth about 30 improved children&#8217;s lives.</p>

<p>Now, given that <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_(economics)#Axioms_of_order)'>our preferences are transferrable</a> then, since one improved child&#8217;s life is worth four lives saved in Africa, then 30 improved children&#8217;s lives are worth 120 lives saved in Africa, or one American life.</p>

<p>Such a conclusion strikes me as unaccaptable. While it might be better to save one American life than it is to save one African life, I would sooner save 120 people in Africa than I would save a sole American. I invite you to rework the calculations with your own preferences and come to your own conclusion.</p>

<h3 id='seeing_eye_dogs'>Seeing Eye Dogs</h3>

<p>Peter Singer recently spoke about similar issues at TED. One of the examples he gave was the cost of training seeing-eye dogs for the blind when compared with preventing blindness in the third world: you can prevent blindness in more than 400 people for the cost of training one guide dog. Hard to believe? Check out the <a href='http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html'>talk in its entirety</a>.</p>

<h2 id='important_metaproblems'>Important Meta-Problems</h2>

<p>We can class some important problems as meta-problems. These are problems that improve our ability to solve an entire class of important problems. As an example, consider the synthesis of a new prescription drug called &#8220;Polya,&#8221; which improves individual&#8217;s problem solving ability by reducing impulsiveness and, subsequently, procrastination. For a more entertaining look at such a possibility, check out the movie <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless'>Limitless</a>.</p>

<p>Such a drug would increase our ability to solve most, if not all, important problems we can imagine. Thus, the problem of creating such a drug is a meta-problem. Indeed, any work that improves human problem solving ability and the liklihood of goal achievement, through <em>any</em> means, is work on a meta-problem.</p>

<p>The real world is a messy, interconnected, complex, jumble. Our actions are like removing a block from a Jenga tower. We cannot fully anticipate what is going to happen.</p>

<p>Another example of a meta-problem would be improving our forecasting abilities. Breakthroughs in forecasting would improve our ability to understand how our actions will affect the world. We can imagine the invention of some kind of tool that makwa the scientific process more effective. Improved forecasting would be one means of accomplishing that. If we had a better idea of where we ought to be investing our time, we could utilize our resources more effectively.</p>

<p>Advances on meta-problems are sort of like compound interest. By increasing the speed of the scientific process, we increase the progress of the human race, thus spurring us toward more such meta-advances. We achieve these sooner than we would otherwise, thanks to the original advance, creating a feedback loop where faster progress leads to even faster progress.</p>

<h2 id='nick_bostroms_model'>Nick Bostrom&#8217;s Model</h2>

<p>Nick Bostrom presents a model in <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Nf3TcMiHo'>his TEDx talk</a> and in <a href='http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html'>this paper</a> in which he argues that the importance of a problem can be measured on two separate axis.</p>

<p>The first we can think of as severity. As an example, consider how important each of these events are: losing a toenail, losing a toe, losing a foot, losing a leg, dying. These form a continuum of badness.</p>

<p>The second nob that we can likewise turn to modify a problem&#8217;s importance is the number of people it affects. One person losing a toe, ten people losing a toe, a million people losing a toe, everyone losing a toe.</p>

<h2 id='dust_in_eyes'>Dust in Eyes</h2>

<p>Benjamin Franklin made a similar observation long before Bostrom:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating; but when they consider that tho&#8217; dust blown into the eyes of a single person, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small importance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city, and its frequent repetitions, give it weight and consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<span id='quote-attribute'>Benjamin Franklin,<a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/148/pg148.html'><em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em></a></span>
<p>The essence of this quotation is that it is not only a problem&#8217;s severity that defines its importance, but also the number of people it affects. There is a point where a more trivial problem that affects many people is more important than a severe one that affects only a single person.</p>

<p>This is a little counterintuitive. Take something like entering a CAPTCHA. This is a minor inconvenience. Surely, a technological breakthrough that saved a single life would be better than one that eliminated the need for CAPTCHAs, right?</p>

<p>According to Google, <a href='http://www.google.com/recaptcha/learnmore'>150k hours are spent each day solving CAPTCHAs</a>. In comparison, one human life consists of ~657k hours. The world spends an equivalent of one human lifetime solving CAPTCHAs every four days. Thought of this way, solving &#8220;the CAPTCHA problem&#8221; is more important than saving one life.</p>

<h2 id='problems_and_solvability'>Problems and Solvability</h2>

<p>Impossible problems are not important because they are by definition unsolvable. Working on a problem that cannot be solved is a waste of time.</p>

<p>This presents another axis on which we can evaluate a problem&#8217;s importance: ease. It&#8217;s much easier to save one human life than to solve the CAPTCHA problem. The world might be better served by people buying mosquito nets than by people working on CAPTCHA technology.</p>

<p>The expected value of working on a problem depends on the probability of a desirable outcome. Consider two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Work on a rare disease that will save 5 lives. Probability of discovery of a cure: 10%.</li>

<li>Donating enough money to a charity to guarantee saving a single life.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first action has an expected value of .5, while the expected value of the second action is 1. The second action is the better choice. The probability of solving any problem must be taken into account when we attempt to understand the importance of it.</p>

<h2 id='system_neglect'>System Neglect</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>It has always appalled me that really bright scientists almost all work in the most competitive fields, the ones in which they are making the least difference. In other words, if they were hit by a truck, the same discovery would be made by somebody else about 10 minutes later.</p>
</blockquote>
<span id='quote-attribute'>Aubrey de Grey</span>
<p>A major failure mode of human judgment is the failure to take into account context when considering a decision. Let us, again, consider two scenarios.</p>

<ol>
<li>Curing a rare disease that will save 20 lives per year. Discovering the cure is an active area of inquiry within your discipline and there is a 90% chance that someone will discover a cure within the next year regardless of your contribution.</li>

<li>Curing a rare disease that will save 5 lives per year. The disease is absent from the academic literature and most researchers have no idea that it exists. Those that do know of its existence are not interested in finding a cure. There is less than a 1% chance that someone will discover a cure within the next year without your contribution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which should you work on? Which is more important?</p>

<p>Work on number 2 will be more important than work on the first. Solving a problem that would have been solved soon regardless of your contribution is less important than solving one where you will be the decisive factor. It is crucial that one consider the context of a problem, such as the amount of interest there is in solving it.</p>

<p>It follows, then, that one can have a much larger impact in a neglected field than in one that is already saturated with researchers. Most problems that are important but, for whatever reason, not glamorous often fall in this category. Unsexy problems have an advantage.</p>

<p>Consider an entrepreneur trying to decide what field to go into. He would be best served by being the first mover in a new market rather than trying to compete with established players in a mature one.</p>

<h2 id='dimensions_of_lifesaving'>Dimensions of Life-Saving</h2>

<p>So far, we&#8217;ve focused on preventing bad things from happening. Saving lives, preventing blindness, curing disease, that sort of thing. Helping the disadvantged is one way of improving people&#8217;s lives, but focusing on it alone ignores a large class of important problems.</p>

<p>My favorite example of this is true love. Soulmates and true love are just Disney fantasies. I remember the feeling of keen disappointment when I first realized that <a href='http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb07/eternal.aspx'>love has an evolutionary programmed expiration date</a> Hell, I&#8217;m <em>still</em> disappointed.</p>

<p>But what if this wasn&#8217;t inevitable? What if you could take a pill and love someone forever? Such an intervention isn&#8217;t just science fiction. It&#8217;s <a href='http://www.nature.com/news/gene-switches-make-prairie-voles-fall-in-love-1.13112'>already been done with montane voles</a>.</p>

<p>Such a drug illustrates a class of interventions that seek to increase the things that make life worth living: love, happiness, interest, self-growth, intelligence, etc.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been conceptualizing most of these ideas as drug interventions only because the familiarity of them make it an easy metaphor to swallow (pun intended). Genetic engineering could achieve similar or greater effects, as could brain modding, or countless as-of-yet undiscovered technologies. Even something as mundane as cognitive therapy fits the bill.</p>

<h3 id='more'>More</h3>

<p>We don&#8217;t need to limit improving the human condition to technological interventions or psychological techniques. Something as simple as helping a friend achieve their goals or spending time with a loved one, these are good things to do.</p>

<p>So, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s wrong, exactly, to consider time spent with family or friends or loved ones as important, but you need to be aware that it&#8217;s better to improve the lives of as many people as possible, rather than just those nearest to you. There is no convincing reasons to believe that your obligation to help others extends only as far as your family, your community, or your country.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t make much sense, either, to concern yourself exclusively with the welfare of humans, either. I&#8217;m not claiming that animal suffering is more important than human suffering or even as important as human suffering, but it should carry some weight when we make our decisions.</p>

<p>There are many traditional ways in which we can improve human lives.</p>

<h3 id='framing_life_saving'>Framing Life Saving</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note the contrasting ways in which we can think about saving a life. After all, what does saving someone&#8217;s life consist of? Preventing death. Interventions that save lives then are the same thing as interventions that prevent deaths.</p>

<p>When I think of saving lives, things like firefighters and feeding starving children come to mind. However, when I think of preventing death, I think of things like smallpox vaccinations and hand-washing. I think of preventive techniques rather than direct life-saving interventions.</p>

<p>There has been a revolution in modern healthcare focusing on preventive techniques within the last 50 years. It turns out that you can often do a lot more good by focusing on preventing an outbreak than by trying to treat already infected people. A proactive approach can be very effective. The same holds for important work.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the difference between preventing a financial collapse from occuring and bailing out an institution to hasten recovery. Nicholas Taleb, in his book <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_(Taleb_book'>The Black Swan</a>) (which I recommend), presents the following thought experiment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assume that a legislator with courage, influence, intellect, vision, and perseverance manages to enact a law that goes into universal effect and employment on September 10, 2001; it imposes the continuously locked bulletproof doors in every cockpit (at high costs to the struggling airlines)—just in case terrorists decide to use planes to attack the World Trade Center in New York City. I know this is lunacy, but it is just a thought experiment (I am aware that there may be no such thing as a legislator with intellect, courage, vision, and perseverance; this is the point of the thought experiment). The legislation is not a popular measure among the airline personnel, as it complicates their lives. But it would certainly have prevented 9/11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The man who lobbied for such a change in regulation would not be recognized as an American hero. Everyone would underestimate the importance of what he had prevented. After all, no one say the attacks coming, or else we would have done something about it. It follows, then, that no one would understand that such events would have been possible in a world where they didn&#8217;t occur.</p>

<p>A focus, then, on preventing bad things from happening can often be more effective and important than direct interventions to help fix things that are already broken and, we systematically underestimate the impact of preventative measures because we don&#8217;t have vivid memories of things that didn&#8217;t happen. This is not to suggest that feeding starving children isn&#8217;t important. I&#8217;m suggesting that preventing a tragedy may be a more effective way to maximize the good that one can do in the world. That would be, I believe, more imporant work than something that does less good.</p>

<h2 id='the_deviant_scientific_process'>The Deviant Scientific Process</h2>

<p>The scientific process is sort of like being offered an unknown drug at a party and then deciding whether or not to take it. On one end of the spectrum, you might choose to take it and have a profound, life-changing experience. On the other, you might become addicted or even die.</p>

<p>We can think of each experiment as swallowing an unknown pill. It could lead to the development of something amazing, like the internet, or of something terrible, like a bioengineered super smallpox.</p>

<p>I love this metaphor because it presents science as a blind process that pulls technology out of the unknown. When we think of the scientific process this way, it can seem somewhat irresponsible. What if we uncover something truly horrible? Like an atomic bomb that anyone could make.</p>

<p>H.P. Lovecraft expresses this theme in <em>The Road to Madness</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life is a hideous thing, and from the background behind what we know of it peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more hideous. Science, already oppressive with its shocking revelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species &#8211; if separate species we be &#8211; for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id='importance_as_a_social_construct'>Importance as a Social Construct</h1>

<p>One might ask, &#8220;Where does importance come from?&#8221; We can imagine a thought experiment: on an alien planet populated by sentient beings, would they have the same definition of importance that we do? Is importance an objective phenomenon? I think the answer is that our values would be different. I&#8217;m not even sure if they would believe in furthering their values, whatever they are, in the same sense that we think of it.</p>

<p>However, this is not to say that all things are equally important. Even though our own judgments of a problems importance are a construct of our values and do not exist independently of ourselves, this is still a meaningful conception of importance.</p>

<p>We might wonder, then, if importance is founded on the contingencies of human sentiment, does this imply that importance is a matter of consensus? If everyone believes something is important, does that make it important? I don&#8217;t think that this is an easy question to answer.</p>

<p>I think the kneejerk reaction, at least among Americans, would be that, no, importance is not socially defined. It&#8217;s the product of individual judgment. Ironically, their emphasis on individualism in such a response is almost certainly the product of societal influences. I believe there is some merit in both such views and that the confusion comes from attempting to draw a distinction from between them.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, revenge. Most of us would consider an unforgiving attitude, a will-to-vengeance, to be an undesirable character trait. Once upon a time, though, vengeance was a virtue. I&#8217;m not sure where I&#8217;m going with this.</p>

<p>In order to come to a reasonable conclusion about what is important, then, I think we think about the nature of importance systematically. We must test our intuitions against different scenarios. Where are our gut reactions reasonable? Where must they be revised? It is through this process of revision of our beliefs that we become less wrong. Without change, there is no improvement.</p>

<p>How much does public consensus about what is important matter, then? It provides a valuable stepping off point. One can take his own beliefs and those of most people and then begin a process of refinement. As his understanding of the issues grows, he moves past the majority view of importance and draws his own deeper conclusions.</p>

<h1 id='brainstorming_original_urn_analogies'>Brainstorming Original Urn Analogies</h1>

<p>The basic idea I&#8217;m trying to get at is a random sampling of events, such that some may be great and some may be catastrophically bad. The sampling must be such that it&#8217;s random or highly uncertain. It&#8217;s a gamble.</p>

<ul>
<li>Harry Potter&#8217;s funny flavored jelly beans. Sometimes you get something tasty, sometimes you get something horrible.</li>

<li>Catching fish. Sometimes you might catch a shark.</li>

<li>Playing roulette. You don&#8217;t know where the ball will land.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the metaphor, we can consider the scientist sampling from the possible discoveries as an individual and the research as physical action.</p>

<ul>
<li>Various gambling cliches. Flipping a coin, playing the lottery, a roll of the dice.</li>

<li>Having unprotected sex with a stranger.</li>

<li>Asking a girl out on a date. Appearing vulnerable to a stranger.</li>

<li>Ordering a tricky dish at a restraunt, like that pufferfish.</li>

<li>Buying a stock on the stockmarket.</li>

<li>Picking a book at random from library.</li>

<li>Going to a job interview.</li>

<li>Working for a startup.</li>

<p>It seems to me that conceptualizing importance as only what helps the most people discards much of the everyday richness of the notion of what is important. People could very reasonably consider time spent with their children or their dying mother as important and I think maybe this is valid. Shouldn&#8217;t any theory of what is important capture this notion?</p>

<p>What of notions like being true to yourself? Or doing what you believe in? Or the search for truth and meaning? Aren&#8217;t those important?</p>

<p>The sections about predictability can be moved into their own post, as can the section on framing, probably.</p>

<p>A little riffing on the idea of importance.</p>

<p>Imagine that you have a machine that can spit out problems that humanity needs to solve. The machine has six knobs. Each of these knobs can be turned to modify the importance of the problem.</p>

<p>The knobs are: the number of people affected, the amount of good created, the amount of bad prevented, the probability of solving the problem, and the impact your individual contribution will have on the problem.</p>

<h2 id='number_of_people_affected'>Number of People Affected</h2>

<p>Let us imagine turning the knob which specifies the number of people affected. The machine might spit out a problem like: preventing one person from losing a toe.</p>

<p>Now, imagine that we inch the dial up and get a new series of problems. It might spit out something like: preventing ten people from losing a toe, preventing a million people from losing a toe, preventing a billion people from losing a toe, preventing all living people from losing a toe, and preventing all future generations from losing a toe.</p>

<p>It is clear that these problems lie on a continuum of importance. It is better to prevent everyone from losing a toe than from preventing one person from losing a toe.</p>

<h2 id='the_amount_of_good'>The Amount of Good</h2>

<p>The next knob that we can consider is the amount of good that a problem will do. Let&#8217;s spin the knob. Regrowing a toenail, regrowing a toe, a foot, a leg, both legs, both legs and both arms, raising them from the dead.</p>

<p>There is a reason that Christianity celebrates Jesus for raising from the dead and not for regrowing a toenail. Beating death is more important.</p>

<h3 id='preventing_bad'>Preventing Bad</h3>

<p>There is another side to doing good that people often overlook and that is preventing bad things from happening. Nicholas Taleb speaks to this in his book The Black Swan (which I recommend).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TK insert black swan quote</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id='probability_of_solving_a_problem'>Probability of Solving a Problem</h2>

<p>You can imagine turning this knob and the machine spitting out a list of problems with different probabilities of you solving them. On the one end, you would have impossible problems and, on the other, you would have very easy to solve problems.</p>

<p>The less difficult a problem, the more important it is going to be to work on it. This seems counterintuitive only because we have be instilled with the notion that it is virtuous to do something hard.</p>

<p>An example will make it clear. You put the knob on low difficulty and it spits out a problem: do TK and save 5 lives with 100% probability. Turn the knob towards difficult: do TK and save 5 lives with 5% probability. It is clearly going to be better to work on the first problem.</p>

<h2 id='individual_impact'>Individual Impact</h2>

<p>The last knob I want to consider is the amount of impact that you, as an individual, will have on the problem. We can again imagine the machine has given us two problems, each corresponding with different degrees of individual impact:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Curing a rare disease that will save 20 lives per year. Discovering the cure is an active area of inquiry within your discipline and there is a 90% chance that someone will discover a cure within the next year regardless of your contribution.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Curing a rare disease that will save 5 lives per year. The disease is absent from the academic literature and most researchers have no idea that it exists. Those that do know of its existence are not interested in finding a cure. There is less than a 1% chance that someone will discover a cure within the next year without your contribution.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='values'>Values</h2>

<p>Importance is not an objective characteristic. It is not out there in the world as a thing separate from human cognition. It is a part of the way that we view the worlds and intimately connected to human sentiment. There is no reason to suspect that an independently evolved alien race would value the same things that we value.</p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that two people should even necessarily value the same things. We all have unique points of view, thanks to differences in genetics and differences in experience, which have shaped the way that we think of how things are important.</p>

<p>My attempt in this post is not to convince you that you must agree with my assessment of importance or that there&#8217;s only one way to determine whether something is important. A mother might claim that the most important thing she ever did was raise her children. Or a Buddhist might claim that the most important thing he ever did was master the dharma and conquer himself.</p>

<p>The intention of presenting this imaginary importance machine is to illustrate a few dimensions along which the importance of a piece of work can be evaluated, different ways of looking at something. They strike me as plausible.</p>
