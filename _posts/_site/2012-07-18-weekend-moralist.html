<p>It&#8217;s midnight. I&#8217;m wide awake. I won&#8217;t be sleeping tonight. I have the movie <em>Alien</em> streaming on the television via the Boxee Box, but I haven&#8217;t been paying any attention. I have only the vaguest notion of what&#8217;s going on. I know they&#8217;re on a spaceship and that they&#8217;re being attacked by some parasitic life form. From the film&#8217;s title and the creature&#8217;s appearance, I gather (quite astutely) it&#8217;s an alien.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m drinking coffee. The mug is off-white and curved, non-traditional. A sort of faux-retro look that could be described as &#8220;modern.&#8221; The irony does not fail to make an impression on me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just swallowed two round red pills of acetamo-something for a headache, which the coffee is exacerbating. I keep drinking it, regardless.</p>

<p>Whenever some woman &#8211; it&#8217;s always a woman &#8211; tells me that she&#8217;s addicted to caffeine or Facebook or shopping or reality television or one of a million other banal, modern vices, I visualize the word imbecile tattooed across her forehead. Our society glorifies addiction, impulsiveness, instant gratification, the one-click checkout. Temperance: a cardinal virtue? Nah, a relic of the Victorian era.</p>

<p>Our religions are no longer religion. Our religions are hobbies. Nietzsche had it wrong. God isn&#8217;t dead. He&#8217;s a dilettante, a dabbler, a weekend moralist.</p>
