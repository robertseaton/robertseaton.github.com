<p>It&#8217;s not always obvious <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6138/1265.full'>what research is going to pay off</a>. Research into apparently trivial things can <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_of_chance_in_scientific_discoveries'>sometimes have a large impact</a>.</p>

<p>Experiments on microscopic worms discovered &#8220;a fundamental mechanism for controlling the flow of genetic information.&#8221; This work <a href='http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2006/press.html'>won the Nobel Prize in 2006</a>. It is far from obvious that work on microscopic worms would lead to anything worthwhile.</p>

<p>Imagine a world in which all of the consequences of an experiment were obvious. That is, we wouldn&#8217;t know which way an experiment was going to pan out, but we would know all of the consequences of all of the possible results. If this were the case, prioritizing what issues to look into would be simple. We would have a crystal ball that would tell us where to allocate resources.</p>

<p>Instead, we live in a world so complex that our forecasting abilities are limited. The President stubs his toe, mistakes the cause of the resulting frustration for the situation in the Middle East and, then, declares war on Iraq. We have this <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control'>illusion of control</a> over the world around us, but it&#8217;s just that: an illusion. We are as a blind man who believes he can see. Who knows what will happen?</p>

<p>Look at all of the results that came out of the space program: scratch resistant lenses and enriched baby food, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spin-off_technologies'>among other things</a>. Who would have predicted the space race producing those specific technologies? Nobody.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate the effects that the invention of the computer have had our modern life. While it seems obvious in retrospect that computers were going to transform the world, the above quotes illustrate that it was anything but. After all, it was Tom Watson&#8217;s job to understand what was coming.</p>

<p>Beyond fundamentally altering our day-to-day life and the way we relate to other people, the invention of the computer led to the creation of numerous new fields of scientific inquiry: computational linguistics and theoretical computer science are two of many.</p>

<p>Further, any fields have been enriched by the invention of the computer. No one thought linguistics was all that interesting before we found out how difficult it was to teach a computer to parse language, computational models led to information processing models of congition in cognitive science, computers have revolutionized forecasting and modeling techniques, to name a few. Computers permeate every aspect of our culture, even changing the way we think about and produce works of art.</p>

<p>This demonstrates how difficult it can be to estimate the impact that a scientific breakthrough is going to have or, indeed, whether or not it is even a breakthrough. Many profound scientific results are so far ahead of their time that their worth is only recognized by the establishment many years later. Bayes&#8217; Theorem, for example, wasn&#8217;t popularized until <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_theorem#History'>rediscovered by Laplace</a> and the &#8220;Bayesian Revolution&#8221; in the sciences is a recent, and ongoing, process. Gregor Mendel&#8217;s groundbreaking work on the laws of genetic inheritance <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel#Life_after_the_pea_experiments'>wasn&#8217;t recognized until being rediscovered after his death</a>.</p>

<h3 id='understanding_increased_intelligence'>Understanding Increased Intelligence</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s possible that we will soon be able to increase our own intelligence through some kind of technological intervention. Before deciding whether it would be good or bad to do so, we want to understand the consequences of such an action.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to evaluate the direct effects of increasing our own intelligence, though, consider a similar situation: imagine that such an intervention was available to one of our evolutionary ancestors, similar to a modern chimpanzee.</p>

<p>Now, what kinds of things might our ancestor have expected from increased intelligence? An improved ability to find food, use tools, stuff like that.</p>

<p>What wouldn&#8217;t they consider? What things do we have today that would have been impossible for any animal to imagine half a million years ago? Or even ten thousand? We have airplanes, we&#8217;ve been to the moon, we have books, movies, literature, all of the intricacies of human culture, and more. Consider the richness of our own mental lives. Consider the depth and intensity of our emotional experience: love, hate, grief, humor, amusement, awe, gratitude.</p>

<p>It would be foolish to expect that smarter humans would be just like us, but better. They would be radically, unimaginably foreign to us.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t science fiction. If we don&#8217;t blow ourselves up and enter a new dark age, or worse, there&#8217;s a good probability of such an intervention being invented this century. It might be <em>just around the corner</em>.</p>

<h2 id='is_the_unexpected_a_real_objection'>Is the Unexpected a Real Objection?</h2>

<p>Even though scientific discoveries sometimes come out of unexpected domains, this is a red herring. While we can appreciate that it might be theoretically possible for, say, someone studying underwater basket weaving to produce important work, this strikes us, rightly, as implausible. The expected value of some research is higher than others.</p>

<p>At this point, it behooves us to ask ourselves, &#8220;So what? Given that we live in an unpredictable world, what ramifications does that have? Does this change anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>It highlights the importance of figuring out means of more effective forecasting and attempting to understand all of the consequences of our decisions. It also illustrates that it might sometimes make sense to invest in long-shot research.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s not all that significant of an objection. Things that we deem more important are still going to be, on average, more important than the things that seem trivial. The trivial sometimes isn&#8217;t trivial, but it usually is.</p>

<h2 id='research_as_a_decision_under_uncertainty'>Research as a Decision Under Uncertainty</h2>

<p>The problem of &#8220;what research matters&#8221; can be thought of as a a decision under uncertainty and, as such, one could decide what to invest their resources in by</p>

<h3 id='forecasting_as_a_means_of_risk_mitigation'>Forecasting as a Means of Risk Mitigation</h3>

<p>I mentioned the importance of effective forecasting earlier in regard to improving the scientific process through more efficient resource allocation. It&#8217;s also an important component of effective risk mitigation.</p>

<p>Imagine a future where advanced nanotechnology is developed before effective nanotechnology defenses. We can, then, imagine a scenario such as the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a common practice, billions of nanobots are released to clean up an oil spill off the coast of Louisiana. However, due to a programming error, the nanobots devour all carbon based objects, instead of just the hydrocarbons of the oil. The nanobots destroy everything, all the while, replicating themselves. Within days, the planet is turned to dust.</p>
</blockquote>
<span id='quote-attribute'>Wikipedia, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo'>Grey Goo</a></span>
<p>Unlikely? Hardly. Nuclear missles present a similar scenario from our recent past. The ability to launch a nuclear attack was developed long before the means to defend against one.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important, then, to understand just what consequences our actions are going to have. What will happen if we fund more nanotechnology research? Will research into fundamental physics at CERN destroy the universe? Will advancing computer hardware increase the liklihood of producing a hostile superintelligence? These are questions of great practical significance that will become more and more relevant as these technologies approach fruition.</p>

<p>We can&#8217;t rely on trial-and-error to deal with existential risk. One such catastrophe will wipe out the human race. There will be no opportunity to learn from our mistakes.</p>
