There was a post about a week ago about how new computer science students don't
get [the Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and the
power (and great responsibility) of the command line. I don't know these people. Most
of my dev time is between Emacs, a terminal, and a web browser.

But during this discussion, or maybe in the article itself, there was an
argument along the lines of: kids don't need to learn how to use `find` or
`locate` when they have Spotlight, and I nodded along, swallowing this like so
much bad medicine.

Until, just moments ago, I went to open up Google Chrome and was like, hey, I'll
just use Spotlight to do it. So I tried. And I waited, and then waited a bit
more, and remembered: oh, right, *Spotlight is a piece of shit that never
actually manages to find anything*. Need to search for something? Oh, too
bad, out of commission, I'm busy indexing your entire machine for the one
hundredth time today and, surprise, this breaks the entire utility.

(Googling around seems to reveal this as an OS X bug fixed in a more recent
update. No doubt that introduces more bugs and the Sisyphean cycle continues.)
