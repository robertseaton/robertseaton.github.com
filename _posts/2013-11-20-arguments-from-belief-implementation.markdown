The standard argument against nihilism -- the notion that life is an affair
devoid of meaning -- goes something like this: Nihilists don't
actually believe anything they're saying because they still act as
though the world is ordered. They still value *something*, like freedom from
pain, and this is revealed through their actions.

The implication, then, is that nihilism is bullshit. If people believed it, they would act differently, so you need to pay no attention to
nihilism, because no one really believes it anyways.

This is not a satisfying
refutation. The argument relies on the notion that one's beliefs and one's
actions need to be aligned. If Andy says that he believes your pet Burmese python,
Handsome, is harmless, but is hesitant to hold him, then Andy is a
fucking liar. 

But that's brain damaged. You can believe something on one level while not
accepting it on another. You can believe that the odds of being attacked by a
shark are nigh non-existent, but still be afraid to swim in the ocean. You can
believe that you really ought to stop eating unhealthy food and keep eating it anyways. I know that the Earth is hurtling around the sun at 67,000 miles
per hour, but it sure doesn't feel like it.

The behavior of those who hold a belief doesn't speak to the accuracy of that
belief. There are a lot of stupid atheists, but that's not evidence either way
as to whether or not there is a God. There are a lot of utilitarians failing to
live up to the moral standards they set for themselves, but this doesn't mean
they don't *really* believe it, and whether or not someone *really* believes
something doesn't speak to the truth of that belief.

If humans are incapable of being perfect nihilists, this is a fact about human
capabilities, not about the truth of nihilism.
