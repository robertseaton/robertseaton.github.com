* [Useful Science](http://usefulscience.org/) is a super cool website, aimed at summarizing instrumentally useful science. Example [from the site](http://usefulscience.org/post/morning-sunlight-exposure-makes-it-easier-wake-early-next-day): "Thirty minutes of sunlight exposure in the morning makes it easier to wake up early the next day." Bonus: my [software tools to improve writing](http://rs.io/2014/03/07/tools-for-writing.html) post is referenced in the site's style guide.

* Why are large companies so inefficient? Because they lack an internal price mechanism -- From [Valve's economist](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/why-valve-or-what-do-we-need-corporations-for-and-how-does-valves-management-structure-fit-into-todays-corporate-world/): "And yet, quite paradoxically, firms can be thought of as market-free zones. Within their realm, firms (like societies) allocate scarce resources (between different productive activities and processes). Nevertheless they do so by means of some non-price, more often than not hierarchical, mechanism!"

## Health, Exercise, Sports

* "[Epidemiological studies of walkers](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0081098), for instance, have found that those whose usual pace is brisk tend to live longer than those who move at a more leisurely rate, even if their overall energy expenditure is similar." (via [Gretchen Reynolds](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/for-fitness-push-yourself/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-nytimes&_r=2&))

## Sex

* "The idea that men are naturally more interested in sex than women is [so] ubiquitous that it’s difficult to imagine that people ever believed differently. And yet for most of Western history, from ancient Greece to beginning of the nineteenth century, [women were assumed to be the sex-crazed porn fiends of their day](http://www.alternet.org/when-women-wanted-sex-much-more-men?paging=off&current_page=1#bookmark)."

* "[Telegony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegony_%28pregnancy%29) is the ancient and medieval idea that a woman’s children could inherit characteristics not only from their father, but from all the woman’s previous sexual partners. It was seriously defended right up until the real mechanisms of genetics were pinned down in the late 19th and early 20th centuries." (via [SlateStarCodex](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/11/links-for-july-2014/))


## Trivia

* "O. J. Simpson was considered briefly [for the part of Terminator], but producers felt [he seemed too nice to play a killer](http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/20/ign-presents-the-history-of-terminator)."

* There are no nations with an older minimum drinking age than the United States (the Puritans are still at work, I guess). No entire nations, anyways. [In some Indian states, you must be 25 to purchase alcohol.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_laws_of_India#Legal_drinking_age)

* [Within a  24 hour period, bamboo can grow four feet.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo)

[They never looked back.](http://books.google.com/books?id=RiOgcvMEioUC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=monkeys+that+washed+potatoes+in+salt+water&source=bl&ots=bxK7S8eGym&sig=dkZPDnBLBHMJw5P5wByQOw0OsYo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MGrEU8TXMYeSyATak4LgCA&ved=0CCsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=monkeys%20that%20washed%20potatoes%20in%20salt%20water&f=false)

* The [phrase "with a grain of salt"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_of_salt) originates from Pliny the Elder's *Naturalis Historia*, which reported that a grain of salt was an ingredient for a poison antidote. Thus, if a meal was poisoned, you'd take it "with a grain of salt."
