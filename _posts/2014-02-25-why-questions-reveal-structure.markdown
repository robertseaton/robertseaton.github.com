Consider two sentences:

* The llama was made out of watermelon flavored cactus.
* Policeman doe terminology star inconvenience recruit.

If I asked you to close this web page and then recall both sentences, you'd have
an easier time with the first sentence. It has meaning and structure -- even
if a bit strange. I could make this still harder by adding a third sentence
that's just a jumble of letters. That would be less structured and even harder
to recall. 

Let's say you're reading a textbook, like Sedgewick's *The Algorithm Design
Manual*, and you come across the fact that \\( \Theta(n \lg n) \\) is the lowest
possible complexity of a comparison sort algorithm. You could commit this to
long-term memory as is -- it's true, after all. It would be connected to *some*
other knowledge, like what you already know about sorting algorithms. This seems
okay.

But, when doing something like this, you're missing out on a whole lot of
structure. If you forgot about the lower bound, you wouldn't be able to
regenerate it from what you already know. It's connected to other knowledge, but
it's not recomputable. You're forced to take Sedgewick's word for the whole
thing.

How can we absorb more of the structure of a piece of knowledge -- to not be
content with knowing a fact that someone else has stated, but to be able to
recompute it, to solidly place it in [our web of knowledge](http://rs.io/2014/02/24/compressing-knowledge.html)? The answer is the
question, "Why?" There is a massive gulf between knowing *that* something is true
and understanding *why* something is true. Being able to answer that why
question makes all the difference -- it forces you to absorb and understand
deeper structural characteristics. 

If I told you that 3 bits can represent 8 different values, you would not be
able to answer the question, "How many bits do you need to represent 1729
different values?" But, if you understood why 3 bits can represent 8 values,
that sort of question is trivial. It's the difference between being able to
regurgitate facts from Wikipedia and being able to solve novel problems -- to
understand the not yet seen. 

**Asking "Why is this so?" is an easy to implement strategy for absorbing a piece
of knowledge, and connecting it to the rest of your beliefs in such a way that
you can answer novel questions in the future.**

  interrogation. There's a review of its effectiveness, along with that of other
