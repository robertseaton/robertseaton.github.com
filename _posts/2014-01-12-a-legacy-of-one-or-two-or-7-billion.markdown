I have heard tell of a time in a man's life where he begins to worry less about
his own dreams and invests more in living through his children. His children
will be his legacy.

This is a very real and common thing that people value: leaving behind
something of some permanence, and children are one means to achieving this. I
would like to suggest, though, a broader view of things, of thinking about
humanity as a whole as a legacy.

First, realize that there are a whole lot of people that are sorta like you out
there in the world. For one, you have a lot more in common with every single
human than any chimp; things like speech, thumbs, religion, awe, humor, and no
doubt many others. Zooming in further, even if you're one in a million, there are
eight of you in London.

Stepping back a moment, do we care so much about leaving children behind or
about people like us existing? I find when I try to think of
compelling arguments as to why I ought to prefer myself (and people related to
me) over others, I come up
with nothing. Sure, I do prefer my own welfare. Evolution has guaranteed
that. But as far as compelling justifications goes, I've nothing great. 

Consider, you could get hit by a bus tomorrow and it would be a tragedy, but the
world would go on. People sorta like you would continued to exist. They would
have thoughts not so different from your own. Hopes like yours, values like
yours, feelings like yours. No doubt a fraction of them (maybe very small!)
would be smarter, funnier, prettier, and kinder than you.

It seems silly to me to prefer myself -- at least strongly -- over people sorta like me. As long as they
continue to exist, it doesn't matter much whether or not they share half my genetic material.
