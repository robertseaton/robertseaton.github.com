  <span id="quote-attribute">Derek Parfit, <em>On What Matters</em></span>
  
  
We all have an intuitive sense of how important different issues are. When the
local news reported that the Illinois Congress
[passed a puppy lemon law](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/27/illinois-puppy-lemon-law/2364179/),
I asked myself,
"Puppies? Are you fucking serious? What about unemployment? What about the homeless?"

All of us operate under the assumption that some issues are more important than
others. Even the staunchest post-modernist lives his life in a way that
suggests he believes some matters are more pressing than others. Jay Leno loves to
lampoon pointless research on *The Tonight Show*, usually justifiably so. There
is even a [satirical nobel prize awarded to strange or trivial research](http://www.improbable.com/ig/). 

What makes something important, then? How do we identify important problems? How
do we decide what to work on? Given a choice, we'd all prefer to do
something important. Would you rather cure cancer or fold t-shirts at the local
strip mall? No one wants to waste their life on the trivial. We want purpose. We
want to do meaningful work. 

What about curing cancer makes it so important? The most salient is this: cancer has a huge impact on many lives. According to the CDC, [cancer
kills 7.6 million people each year](http://www.cdc.gov/features/worldcancerday/). Cancer
is a major component of global suffering. 

Further, the horrors of cancer are available in the minds of all of
us. Everyone has been exposed to it via the death of a loved one, seeing it in the media, or hearing about
it from a friend. 

Compare this to something like working on Wall Street. A [recent Gallup poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/149216/americans-rate-computer-industry-best-federal-gov-worst.aspx)
revealed banking as one of America's most hated industries. Why do people hate
banking? Because bankers don't seem to create much value for
society. They control a disproportionate amount of wealth for how much positive impact they have on the world. 

My friends and family often express outrage at the salaries of some
professions. CEOs, professional athletes, and coaches are most often the targets
of their incredulity. Why does this bother them? They don't feel that it's fair that these people make
so much money for what they do. Do athletes improve the world? To some extent,
yes, but many people are getting paid far less for
doing much more. The value of great humanitarians is not reflected in their
salaries. 

Take folding clothes at the mall as another example. It's not recognized as an important
job. Why not? Because it doesn't have a significant impact on
any of our lives. Folded clothes at the mall just don't matter. No one is
better off.

## Impact

Some things we recognize as important because they have wide-ranging
consequences for a lot of people. The invention of the atomic bomb changed the
world, as did the automobile, the telephone, the lightbulb, and the internet.

One of the characteristics of important work is that it improves the human
condition. Affecting a lot of people is not sufficient for
importance. Imagine a scientist that manages to change the sky purple. Nothing
negative or positive results from this beyond the fact that, now, when people
look up on a clear day, they see a purple sky.

Is this important work? No. We can imagine a similar scenario where an
advertising campaign familiarizes everyone with a product and that's all. Just
because a lot of people might be affected, that
doesn't mean it's important or worthwhile. Indeed, a lot of
advertising strikes me as downright evil. Manufacturing new insecurities or
otherwise intensifying existing ones to sell a product is an attack on
individual well-being.



## Where Our Intuitions Break Down

Our intuitions about what matters are the crude products of evolution. Our species did not evolve to deal with problems of the scope
and quality that we currently face. We're adapted for [communities of between fifty and two
hundred individuals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number#Research_background), not a global community of billions.

Humans suck at dealing with large numbers or subtle degrees. Consider a scientist who devises a cure for a rare, but lethal,
disease that affects about five people each year. Most people would consider
that very important work. After all, he is saving lives.

Now, consider someone who works in finance and makes several hundred
thousand dollars each year, but who donates $20,000 each year to [GiveWell's top
rated charity](http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities).

Who is doing more important work? I'd wager that most of people would say that the
scientist curing a deadly disease is doing something more important than the
investment banker, but by donating $20,000 dollars to an
effective charity each year, the investment banker is saving 3.7 more
lives than the scientist.

Now whose work is more important?

### Guns and Tobacco

Which is a bigger problem: gun-related deaths or tobacco-related deaths? Judging by the
amount of media attention gun control receives, gun deaths are the more
important problem.

In a way, this makes sense. After all, if someone who understands the
risks that they're taking on by lighting up a cigarette and does it anyways,
their death is their own fault. There's no one to blame. How could this be bad?
It's worse if someone has their life taken from them through no fault
of their own. 

It is reasonable to consider gun deaths worse than tobacco-deaths, even if, as a society, we place way too much emphasize on what's fair, especially
considering that such evaluations are *always* biased by self-interest (INSERT CITATION).

Consider, however, that about [30,000 Americans die each year from gun-related
causes](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm), of which [2/3rds are suicides](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm) Contrast this with 443,000
[tobacco-related deaths each year](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/), of which 49,400 are due to second-hand
smoke.

Now which is worse?

### A Life is a Life is a Life

Are all lives created equal? While most of us _pay lip service to the idea_, we
act otherwise. We spend more time helping our local community and pay little
attention to what's happening in the rest of the world. As a nation, we've invested
[huge amounts of money in a fight against terrorism](http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2008/04/AP_COST/EN/), while [millions die of
poverty related causes each year](http://www.bread.org/hunger/global/).

Some deaths have more impact on the world than others, however and, in that
respect, it does make sense to consider some lives as more important than
others. None of us are outraged that the president receives secret service
protection while we don't.

> I respect those who say that the United States should simply withdraw from the
> Middle East, but I don't respect them for anything but their honesty.
  <span id="quote-attribute">Christopher Hitchens, *The Quotable Hitchens from Alcohol to Zionism: The Very Best of Christopher Hitchens</span>

Given enough time, every discussion of international politics is bound to elicit
something along the lines of: "We shouldn't be getting involved in the Middle
East. We should mind our own business and worry about problems at home." The
assumption behind these statements is that local issues are more important than
those in other countries. There is near universal endorsement of the idea that
we have a greater obligation to help those _near and dear_ to us than to help strangers.

Let us assume that it is better to save an American life than it is to save
someone in Africa. According to GiveWell, the [most efficient U.S. charities need
$10,000 dollars to improve a child's academic performance and reduce academic performance](http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas). Note that this isn't even saving a
life.

In contrast, it costs about $2300 to save a life in Africa by giving to the
[Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.againstmalaria.com/). We have a choice then: save four lives in Africa or
improve the academic and prosocial performance of one child in the United
States.

It might help to further expand on this choice. How many children's lives would
you need to improve in order for that to be the equivalent of saving one life?
This isn't an easy question to answer, especially if you're not used to making
such comparisons. There isn't any "right" answer. It hinges on personal judgment.

You need to ask yourself: at what point am I indifferent between improving the lives of X children and saving one life? Remember, we're only
considering citizens of your own nation here. I would be indifferent
at around 30 children. I figure one life saved is worth about 30 improved
children's lives.

Now, given that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_(economics)#Axioms_of_order)">our preferences are transferrable</a>
then, since one improved
child's life is worth four lives saved in Africa, then 30 improved children's
lives are worth 120 lives saved in Africa, or one American life. 

Such a conclusion strikes me as unaccaptable. While it might be better to save one
American life than it is to save one African life, I would sooner save 120
people in Africa than I would save a sole American. I invite you to rework the
calculations with your own preferences and come to your own conclusion.

### Seeing Eye Dogs

Peter Singer recently spoke about similar issues at TED. One of the examples he gave was the cost of training seeing-eye dogs for
the blind when compared with preventing blindness in the third world: you can prevent blindness in more than 400 people for the cost of
training one guide dog. Hard to believe? Check out the [talk in its
entirety](http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html).

## Important Meta-Problems

We can class some important problems as meta-problems. These are problems that improve our ability to solve an entire class of important
problems. As an example, consider the synthesis of a new prescription drug
called "Polya," which improves individual's problem solving ability by reducing impulsiveness and, subsequently, procrastination. For a
more entertaining look at such a possibility, check out the movie
[Limitless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless).

Such a drug would increase our ability to solve most, if not all, important
problems we can imagine. Thus, the problem of creating such a drug is a
meta-problem. Indeed, any work that improves human problem solving ability and
the liklihood of goal achievement, through *any* means, is work on a
meta-problem.

The real world is a messy, interconnected, complex, jumble. Our actions are like
removing a block from a Jenga tower. We cannot fully anticipate what is going to
happen.

Another example of a meta-problem would be improving our forecasting
abilities. Breakthroughs in forecasting would improve our ability to understand how
our actions will affect the world. We can imagine the invention of some
kind of tool that makwa the scientific process more
effective. Improved forecasting would be one means of accomplishing that. If we
had a better idea of where we ought to be investing our time, we could utilize
our resources more effectively.

Advances on meta-problems are sort of like compound interest. By increasing the
speed of the scientific process, we increase the progress of the human race,
thus spurring us toward more such meta-advances. We achieve these sooner than
we would otherwise, thanks to the original advance, creating a feedback loop
where faster progress leads to even faster progress. 

## Nick Bostrom's Model

Nick Bostrom presents a model in [his TEDx talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Nf3TcMiHo)
and in [this paper](http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html) in which he
argues that the importance of a problem can be measured on two separate
axis.

The first we can think of as severity. As an example, consider how
important each of these events are: losing a toenail, losing a toe, losing a
foot, losing a leg, dying. These form a continuum of badness.

The second nob that we can likewise turn to modify a problem's importance is the
number of people it affects.  One person losing a toe, ten
people losing a toe, a million people losing a toe, everyone losing a toe.


## Dust in Eyes

Benjamin Franklin made a similar observation long before Bostrom:

> Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating; but when
>  they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes of a single person, or into a
>  single shop on a windy day, is but of small importance, yet the great number
>  of the instances in a populous city, and its frequent repetitions, give it
>  weight and consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely those who
>  bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature. 
  <span id="quote-attribute">Benjamin Franklin,<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/148/pg148.html"><em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em></a></span>
  
The essence of this quotation is that it is not only a problem's severity that
defines its importance, but also the number of people it affects. There is a
point where a more trivial problem that affects many people is more important
than a severe one that affects only a single person.

This is a little counterintuitive. Take something like entering a CAPTCHA. This
is a minor inconvenience. Surely, a technological breakthrough that saved a
single life would be better than one that eliminated the need for CAPTCHAs,
right?

According to Google, [150k hours are spent each day solving CAPTCHAs](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/learnmore). In comparison, one human
life consists of ~657k hours. The world spends an equivalent of one human
lifetime solving CAPTCHAs every four days. Thought of this way, solving "the
CAPTCHA problem" is more important than saving one life. 

## Problems and Solvability

Impossible problems are not important because they are by definition
unsolvable. Working on a problem that cannot be solved is a
waste of time.

This presents another axis on which we can evaluate a problem's
importance: ease. It's much easier to save one human life than to solve the CAPTCHA
problem. The world might be better served by people buying mosquito
nets than by people working on CAPTCHA technology.

The expected value of working on a problem depends on the
probability of a desirable outcome. Consider two problems:

1. Work on a rare disease that will save 5 lives. Probability of discovery of a cure: 10%.
2. Donating enough money to a charity to guarantee saving a single life.

The first action has an expected value of .5, while the expected value of the
second action is 1. The second action is the better choice. The probability of
solving any problem must be taken into account when we attempt to understand the importance of it.

## System Neglect


> It has always appalled me that really bright scientists almost all work in the most competitive fields, the ones in which they are making the least difference. In other words, if they were hit by a truck, the same discovery would be made by somebody else about 10 minutes later.
  <span id="quote-attribute">Aubrey de Grey</span>

A major failure mode of human judgment is the failure to take into
account context when considering a decision. Let us, again, consider
two scenarios.

1. Curing a rare disease that will save 20 lives per year. Discovering
the cure is an active area of inquiry within your discipline and there is a 90%
chance that someone will discover a cure within the next year regardless of your
contribution.
2. Curing a rare disease that will save 5 lives per year. The disease is absent
from the academic literature and most researchers have no idea that it
exists. Those that do know of its existence are not interested in finding a
cure. There is less than a 1% chance that someone will discover a cure within
the next year without your contribution.

Which should you work on? Which is more important?

Work on number 2 will be more important than work on the first. Solving a
problem that would have been solved soon regardless of your contribution is less
important than solving one where you will be the decisive factor. It is crucial that one consider the context of a problem, such
as the amount of interest there is in solving it.

It follows, then, that one can have a much larger impact in a neglected field
than in one that is already saturated with researchers. Most problems that are
important but, for whatever reason, not glamorous often fall in
this category. Unsexy problems have an advantage.

Consider an entrepreneur trying to decide what field to
go into. He would be best served by being the first mover in a new market rather
than trying to compete with established players in a mature one.

## Dimensions of Life-Saving

So far, we've focused on preventing bad things from happening. Saving
lives, preventing blindness, curing disease, that sort of thing. Helping the
disadvantged is one way of improving people's lives, but focusing on it alone ignores a large class of important problems.

My favorite example of this is true love. Soulmates and true love are just
Disney fantasies. I remember the feeling of keen disappointment when I first
realized that [love has an evolutionary programmed expiration date](http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb07/eternal.aspx) Hell, I'm
*still* disappointed.

But what if this wasn't inevitable? What if you could take a pill and love
someone forever? Such an intervention isn't just science
fiction. It's
[already been done with montane voles](http://www.nature.com/news/gene-switches-make-prairie-voles-fall-in-love-1.13112).

Such a drug illustrates a class of interventions that seek to increase the
things that make life worth living: love, happiness, interest, self-growth,
intelligence, etc.

I've been conceptualizing most of these ideas as drug interventions only because
the familiarity of them make it an easy metaphor to swallow (pun
intended). Genetic engineering could achieve similar or greater effects, as
could brain modding, or countless as-of-yet undiscovered technologies. Even
something as mundane as cognitive therapy fits the bill.

### More

We don't need to limit improving the human condition to technological
interventions or psychological techniques. Something as simple as helping a
friend achieve their goals or spending time with a loved one, these are good
things to do.

So, I don't think it's wrong, exactly, to consider time spent with family or
friends or loved ones as important, but you need to be aware that it's better to
improve the lives of as many people as possible, rather than just those nearest
to you. There is no convincing reasons to believe that your obligation to help
others extends only as far as your family, your community, or your country.

It doesn't make much sense, either, to concern yourself exclusively with the
welfare of humans, either. I'm not claiming that animal suffering is more
important than human suffering or even as important as human suffering, but it
should carry some weight when we make our decisions.

There are many traditional ways in which we can improve human
lives.

### Framing Life Saving

It's interesting to note the contrasting ways in which we can think about saving
a life. After all, what does saving someone's life consist of? Preventing
death. Interventions that save lives then are the same thing as interventions
that prevent deaths.

When I think of saving lives, things like firefighters and feeding starving
children come to mind. However, when I think of preventing death, I think of
things like smallpox vaccinations and hand-washing. I think of preventive
techniques rather than direct life-saving interventions.

There has been a revolution in modern healthcare focusing on preventive
techniques within the last 50 years. It turns out that you can often do a lot
more good by focusing on preventing an outbreak than by
trying to treat already infected people. A proactive approach can be very
effective. The same holds for important work.

It's the difference between preventing a financial collapse from occuring and
bailing out an institution to hasten recovery. Nicholas Taleb, in his book [The
Black Swan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_(Taleb_book)) (which I
recommend), presents the following thought experiment:

>  Assume that a legislator with courage, influence, intellect, vision, and
>  perseverance manages to enact a law that goes into universal effect and
>  employment on September 10, 2001; it imposes the continuously locked
>  bulletproof doors in every cockpit (at high costs to the struggling
>  airlines)—just in case terrorists decide to use planes to attack the World
>  Trade Center in New York City. I know this is lunacy, but it is just a thought
>  experiment (I am aware that there may be no such thing as a legislator with
>  intellect, courage, vision, and perseverance; this is the point of the thought
>  experiment). The legislation is not a popular measure among the airline
>  personnel, as it complicates their lives. But it would certainly have
>  prevented 9/11.

The man who lobbied for such a change in regulation would not be recognized as
an American hero. Everyone would underestimate the importance of what he had
prevented. After all, no one say the attacks coming, or else we would have done
something about it. It follows, then, that no one would understand that such
events would have been possible in a world where they didn't occur.

A focus, then, on preventing bad things from happening can often be more effective and important than direct interventions to help fix
things that are already broken and, we systematically underestimate the impact
of preventative measures because we don't have vivid memories of things that
didn't happen. This is not to suggest that feeding starving
children isn't important. I'm suggesting that preventing a tragedy may be a more
effective way to maximize the good that one can do in the world. That would be,
I believe, more imporant work than something that does less good. 

## The Deviant Scientific Process

The scientific process is sort of like being offered an unknown drug at a party
and then deciding whether or not to take it. On one end of the spectrum, you might choose to take it and
have a profound, life-changing experience. On the other, you might become
addicted or even die.

We can think of each experiment as swallowing an unknown pill. It could lead to the
development of something amazing, like the internet, or of something terrible,
like a bioengineered super smallpox.

I love this metaphor because it presents science as a blind process that pulls
technology out of the unknown. When we think of the scientific process this way,
it can seem somewhat irresponsible. What if we uncover something truly horrible?
Like an atomic bomb that anyone could make.

H.P. Lovecraft expresses this theme in *The Road to Madness*:

> Life is a hideous thing, and from the background behind what we know of it
>  peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more
>  hideous. Science, already oppressive with its shocking revelations, will
>  perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species -- if separate
>  species we be -- for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by
>  mortal brains if loosed upon the world.

# Importance as a Social Construct

One might ask, "Where does importance come from?" We can imagine a thought
experiment: on an alien planet populated by sentient beings, would they have the
same definition of importance that we do? Is importance an objective phenomenon?
I think the answer is that our values would be different. I'm not even sure if
they would believe in furthering their values, whatever they are, in the same
sense that we think of it.

However, this is not to say that all things are equally important. Even though
our own judgments of a problems importance are a construct of our
values and do not exist independently of ourselves, this is still a meaningful
conception of importance.

We might wonder, then, if importance is founded on the contingencies of human
sentiment, does this imply that importance is a matter of consensus?
If everyone believes something is important, does that make it important? I
don't think that this is an easy question to answer.

I think the kneejerk reaction, at least among Americans, would be that, no,
importance is not socially defined. It's the product of individual
judgment. Ironically, their emphasis on individualism in such a response is
almost certainly the product of societal influences. I believe there is some
merit in both such views and that the confusion comes from attempting to draw a
distinction from between them.

Take, for instance, revenge. Most of us would consider an unforgiving attitude,
a will-to-vengeance, to be an undesirable character trait. Once upon a time,
though, vengeance was a virtue. I'm not sure where I'm going with this.

In order to come to a reasonable conclusion about what is important, then, I
think we think about the nature of importance systematically. We must test our
intuitions against different scenarios. Where are our gut reactions reasonable?
Where must they be revised? It is through this process of revision of our
beliefs that we become less wrong. Without change, there is no improvement.

How much does public consensus about what is important matter, then? It provides
a valuable stepping off point. One can take his own beliefs and those of most
people and then begin a process of refinement. As his understanding of the
issues grows, he moves past the majority view of importance and draws his own
deeper conclusions. 

# Brainstorming Original Urn Analogies

The basic idea I'm trying to get at is a random sampling of events, such that
some may be great and some may be catastrophically bad. The sampling must be
such that it's random or highly uncertain. It's a gamble.

- Harry Potter's funny flavored jelly beans. Sometimes you get
something tasty, sometimes you get something horrible.
- Catching fish. Sometimes you might catch a shark.
- Playing roulette. You don't know where the ball will land.

In the metaphor, we can consider the scientist sampling from the possible
discoveries as an individual and the research as physical action.

- Various gambling cliches. Flipping a coin, playing the lottery, a roll of the
  dice.
- Having unprotected sex with a stranger.
- Asking a girl out on a date. Appearing vulnerable to a stranger.
- Ordering a tricky dish at a restraunt, like that pufferfish.
- Buying a stock on the stockmarket.

In a sense, any decision under uncertainty is a sort of metaphor.

- Picking a book at random from library.
- Switching your playlist to shuffle.
- Going to a job interview.
- Working for a startup.
- Playing russion roulette.
- Telling someone you love them.
- Leaps of faith, e.g. bungee jumping, a literal leap.
- Getting a haircut with a new stylist.
- Opening a birthday present.
- Driving a car.
- Drinking and driving.
- Pulling a name out of a hat.
- Shooting a basket.
- Choosing which words to use in a conversation.
- Choosing a careeer.
- Spinning the Wheel of Fortune.
- Betting on The Daily Double on Jeopardy.
- Writing a book.

It should be something that can be done repeatedly.

- Checking your shoes for spiders.
- Buying a bag of crap off Woot.
- Cracking an egg.

The core components of the metaphor:
- An actor.
- A sample from a random-ish distribution of outcomes.
- At least one good and one bad outcome.

- Looking for stuff with a metal-detector. Sometimes find rings, sometimes find
  landmines.
- Eating something off the floor.
- Crossing the street.
- Buying a pack of pokemon (or baseball) cards, or magic the gathering.
- Releasing an album.
- Bidding on a contract.
- Entering a competition.
- Buying insurance.
- Leaving the house.
- Getting a flu vaccine.
- Ingesting an unknown substance at a party, like a designer drug.

I'm liking the designer drug metaphor.

- Taking a shortcut through a dangerous neighborhood.
- Trying a new food.
- Listening to a new radio station.
- Hitting "I'm feeling lucky" on Google
- Going on a blind date
- Having a routine surgery done
- Roofing a house.
- Boxing.
- Answering the door.
- Grabbing a piece of halloween candy from a bowl.
- Adopting a child.
- Opening a strange package in the mail.
- Getting on an airplane.
- Crossing the street without looking.
- Installing new software.
- Running a software upgrade.
- Digging for fossils.
- Exploring a new frontier.
- Bluffing.

# Things That Affect Many People But Aren't Important

- Advertisements.
- Weather.
- Fashion.
- Sports teams winning or losing.
- Reality television.
- The 

# Free Formin'

It seems to me that conceptualizing importance as only what helps the most
people discards much of the everyday richness of the notion of what is
important. People could very reasonably consider time spent with their children
or their dying mother as important and I think maybe this is valid. Shouldn't
any theory of what is important capture this notion?

What of notions like being true to yourself? Or doing what you believe in? Or
the search for truth and meaning? Aren't those important?

# What does importance look like?

- A nuclear detonation.
- A picture of the earth from space.
- The galaxy.
- Large things.
- Like reaching out and helping someone.
- Grabbing someone when they're about to fall off a cliff.
- Like a lone scientist, peering into life's mysteries.
- Like two atoms colliding.
- Like a newborn child.

# Components of Importance

- Lives directly improved.
- Prevention of bad things from happening. (Death, suffering.)
- Number of people affected, including future generations.
- Probability of solving the problem, expected utility.
- System neglect. Will the problem be solved if I don't work on it?
- Direct and indirect effects.

The sections about predictability can be moved into their own post, as can the
section on framing, probably. 

A little riffing on the idea of importance.

Imagine that you have a machine that can spit out problems that humanity needs
to solve. The machine has six knobs. Each of these knobs can be turned to modify
the importance of the problem. 

The knobs are: the number of people affected, the amount of good created, the
amount of bad prevented, the probability of solving the problem, and the impact your
individual contribution will have on the problem.

## Number of People Affected

Let us imagine turning the knob which specifies the number of people affected. The machine might spit out a problem
like: preventing one person from losing a toe.

Now, imagine that we inch the dial up and get a new series of problems. It might
spit out something like: preventing ten people from losing a toe, preventing a
million people from losing a toe, preventing a billion people from losing a toe,
preventing all living people from losing a toe, and preventing all future
generations from losing a toe.

It is clear that these problems lie on a continuum of importance. It is better
to prevent everyone from losing a toe than from preventing one person from
losing a toe. 

## The Amount of Good

The next knob that we can consider is the amount of good that a problem will
do. Let's spin the knob. Regrowing a toenail, regrowing a toe, a
foot, a leg, both legs, both legs and both arms, raising them from the
dead.

There is a reason that Christianity celebrates Jesus for raising from the dead
and not for regrowing a toenail. Beating death is more important. 

### Preventing Bad

There is another side to doing good that people often overlook and that is
preventing bad things from happening. Nicholas Taleb speaks to this in his book
The Black Swan (which I recommend).

## Probability of Solving a Problem

You can imagine turning this knob and the machine spitting out a list of
problems with different probabilities of you solving them. On the one end, you
would have impossible problems and, on the other, you would have very easy to
solve problems.

The less difficult a problem, the more important it is going to be to work on
it. This seems counterintuitive only because we have be instilled with the
notion that it is virtuous to do something hard.

An example will make it clear. You put the knob on low difficulty and it spits
out a problem: do TK and save 5 lives with 100% probability. Turn the knob
towards difficult: do TK and save 5 lives with 5% probability. It is clearly
going to be better to work on the first problem.

## Individual Impact

The last knob I want to consider is the amount of impact that you, as an
individual, will have on the problem. We can again imagine the machine has given
us two problems, each corresponding with different degrees of individual impact:

1. Curing a rare disease that will save 20 lives per year. Discovering
the cure is an active area of inquiry within your discipline and there is a 90%
chance that someone will discover a cure within the next year regardless of your
contribution.

2. Curing a rare disease that will save 5 lives per year. The disease is absent
from the academic literature and most researchers have no idea that it
exists. Those that do know of its existence are not interested in finding a
cure. There is less than a 1% chance that someone will discover a cure within
the next year without your contribution.


## Values

Importance is not an objective characteristic. It is not out there in the world
as a thing separate from human cognition. It is a part of the way that we view
the worlds and intimately connected to human sentiment. There is no reason to
suspect that an independently evolved alien race would value the same things
that we value.

There is no reason to believe that two people should even necessarily value the
same things. We all have unique points of view, thanks to differences in
genetics and differences in experience, which have shaped the way that we think
of how things are important.

My attempt in this post is not to convince you that you must agree with my
assessment of importance or that there's only one way to determine whether
something is important. A mother might claim that the most important thing she
ever did was raise her children. Or a Buddhist might claim that the most
important thing he ever did was master the dharma and conquer himself.

The intention of presenting this imaginary importance machine is to illustrate a
few dimensions along which the importance of a piece of work can be evaluated,
different ways of looking at something. They strike me as plausible.
