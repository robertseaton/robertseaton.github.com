title: The Terrible Future Isn't, Drone Delivery Edition

Last night, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos appeared on *60 Minutes* and spoke about [the
possibility of using drones to deliver small packages](http://mashable.com/2013/12/01/amazon-unveils-flying-robot-delivery-drones/). My gut reaction is the
engineer's natural skepticism: I'll believe it when he's rolled out
something that works instead of touting vaporware. (Remember [hyperloop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop)? Yeah,
[that's never going to happen](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/20948).) That's not so fun to read
about, though, so let's instead talk about the promise of drone delivery.

The setup: imagine that anything a drone can carry can be delivered to
your door within 30 minutes of purchase, provided that someone has it within ten
miles of your location.

My initial thought, given that I have yet to eat breakfast, is food delivery. You don't order meals through Amazon
because you don't want to wait two days when you're hungry. Given that there are already
businesses -- pizza delivery, for one -- in this market, I could see it happening. Indeed, if drones become
easy and cheap enough that small businesses can afford them, we could see
scenarios where women working from home make fresh food (cookies or lasagna
or what-have-you) to order via the internet. Chefs working from home and
delivering meals via drone could disrupt the restaurant industry.

More prosaically, if you're out of bagels or you need some fresh oregano for the
dish you're planning on making for dinner, you could have a drone fly you some
from the grocery store. Or maybe if you need a suit dry-cleaned or a package shipped, a drone could come
and pick up the goods. 

I could see this changing the operation of libraries, too, where you can order a
library book online and then have it delivered to you via drone. The same goes for
prescription medication.

There are certain things that people want to replace as quickly as possible:
television remotes, specialty drill bits, and internet routers. If you have a
pet reptile, you'll know that when their sunning lamp burns out, you want to
replace it pronto. These sort of things would be fine candidates
for drone delivery.

Another interesting potential is the ability to deliver goods to places other
than houses. If you're out camping and forgot to bring hot dogs, a drone could
fly out to your location. Maybe something like this would work for broken down
cars, too, although I'm not sure what you might order. A blanket or hot
chocolate if your car is stuck in the snow, maybe.

I've seen some [talk of this changing the way drug deals go down](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/12/the-economics-of-cheap-drone-delivery.html) because it would
eliminate the risk of a face-to-face transaction. I'm not completely convinced
of this, though, because a police officer could just order drugs online and then
follow the drone back to wherever it came from after delivery. It might still be
safer, though.

Anyways, the focus here has been on incremental improvement and the
disappearance of chores. If drones do pan out, though, the interesting effects
are going to be in how they disrupt markets and enable new types of trade. We
can imagine trying to predict the consequences of the internet or
the the telephone when they were first introduced. The changes wrought were no doubt much
larger than anyone expected. I don't think drones are as fundamental as either
of those, but I do think that -- should the technology come to fruition -- the results
will be quite different from what we anticipate.
