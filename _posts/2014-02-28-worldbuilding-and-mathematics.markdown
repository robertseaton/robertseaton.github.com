title: Worldbuilding and Mathematics

This week, I was introduced to [the hobby of worldbuilding](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding) -- inventing imaginary places, making
maps, elaborating histories. (The platonist in me prefers to think of
worldbuilding as the *discovery* of fictional universes, rather than an act of
invention.)

## Tolkien

There is a (perhaps apocryphal) tale that J. R. R. Tolkien got into a fight with his
publisher over using  the words "elves" and "dwarves" instead of "elfs"
and "dwarfs". The publisher argued that the latter was how the dictionary did
it. "I know," Tolkien responded, "I wrote the dictionary." Tolkien had, in
fact, spent several years as an assistant working on the Oxford English
Dictionary.

Although most known for his fiction, Tolkien was a linguist
at heart, even [inventing some eleven fictional languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_constructed_by_J._R._R._Tolkien) along with a number of
variations on those languages.

The remarkable degree of internal consistency of some Tolkien's language use in
*The Lord of the Rings* is perhaps unsurprising, then. The prefix "mor" in his
work translates literally to black and is used consistently -- Mordor is
black land, moria is black pit, and morranon is black gate. The "dor" in Mordor
means land. Gondor, as you might expect, means stone land. 

Of his languages and *Lord of the Rings*, Tolkien wrote "The invention of
languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world
for the languages than the reverse."

I have no such patience for languages. I have little interesting
in learning a new one, except perhaps Lojban, and less still in attempting to
invent my own, unless we're speaking of programming.

But it does suggest a question: Where would I start with discovering a fictional
universe? If I wanted to maximize the believability of a fictional universe, on
what rock would I put it?

I'm thinking maybe economics. Robin Hanson [recently pointed out](https://www.google.com/search?q=her+movie+robin+hanson&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=sb) that the movie
*Her*, while enjoyable, is far from realistic. Humans invent human-level "strong" AI
and use it... *to chat with.* 

I doubt that's how it's going to play out
in the real world. Why bother hiring a human to do *any* sort of computer work
when an AI can do it faster, better, and cheaper? Newspaper reporter? Computer
has it covered. Secretary? Computer. Author? Computer. Researcher?
Computer. Teacher? Computer. Customer support? Computer.

Talk about a fuck up. In the real world, everything makes a perverted sort of
sense. A causes B causes C, *ad infinitum*. In the real world, physics makes the
rules, and we, well, we're an expression of them. When worldbuilding, there is
no *physics*  ensuring that what you write is consistent. It's up to you.

Discovering a coherent world draws on the same skills that are necessary
for understanding our own world. When the movie *Gravity* was released, it was
[criticized](http://ideas.time.com/2013/10/02/astronaut-gravity-gets-me-down/) for fucking up a whole lot of physics -- vehicles in impossible
orbits, backpacks with unlimited fuel supplies, and indestructible space suits.

That's all ignoring messy details like relationship
mechanics, attraction, and how language works. The movie *Ted* drives me up the
wall -- *not* because there is a magical, talking teddy bear, but because Mark
Wahlburg and Mila Kunis's relationship strikes me as absurd. A chick like that,
decent career, and she's with this unemployed man-child? *Ri-ght*.

All of which is to suggest that the skills and knowledge necessary to understand
this world are the same needed to build your own: economics, game theory,
physics, social dynamics, and so on. The converse is true, too: **to understand
this world, consider the sort of things you'd need to know to build your own.**
Or, as Feynman put it, "What I cannot create, I do not understand."

## The Fractal Nature of Worldbuilding

Worldbuilders often go out of their way to produce natural looking maps -- like by spilling coffee on paper. Here's an
example:

!["Worldbuilding with the coffee-stain technique."](/img/coffee-stain-world.png)

Another technique for generating maps: taking pictures of rusted fire
hydrants.

!["Worldbuilding with a rusted fire hydrant."](/img/world-building-rusted-fire-hydrant.png)

But there's a
whole branch of mathematics for this sorta thing, fractals! Ever notice the
self-similar nature of trees? Each branch looks like a small tree unto
itself. Or coastlines -- each "crevice" of a coastline itself looks like a
coastline. Branches, snowflakes, crystals -- all like this.

Indeed, ever after reading Benoit Mandelbrot's *The Fractal Geometry of Nature*,
I sometimes catch myself seeing fractals superimposed on clouds when I unfocus my
eyes.

## Mathematics and Worldbuilding

Okay, confession: I wasn't 100% honest with you. While this is my first brush
with groups of other worldbuilders, I've toyed with the idea in the past --
after colliding with Tegmark's [mathematical universe hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis) and reading
*Permutation City*.

I wasn't thinking about making maps. I was wondering: How could I model
the essentials of emergent behavior? Is it Conway's game of life -- or something
simpler? How could I simulate a universe? What do the fundamental laws of
our universe look like?

And I started wondering if mathematics wasn't a sort of world unto itself. A set
of axioms with implications of [the sort we could never anticipate](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/18100/theorems-with-unexpected-conclusions) --
implications we are still discovering, who knows what it could lead to? And not
one system of axioms, but infinitely many -- each with different definitions,
objects, theorems, branches, and applications. 

In short, I started to think of the work of a mathematician as being a whole lot
like worldbuilding. Discovering some object that obeys certain rules of logic
and nothing more, and asking, "What does it do? Is such and such true of this
thing? How does it behave here?"

I'm reminded of János Bolyai. Of non-euclidean geometry, he wrote, "Out of
nothing I have created a strange new universe."
