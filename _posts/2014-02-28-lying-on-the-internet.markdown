!["Lying on the internet -- Pinochio."](/img/lying-on-the-internet.png)

Yesterday, I saw someone spin this very plausible theory about why it's so
repellent when someone brags about their IQ on the internet. (For the record,
each time I've been tested I've been told that I'm "off the charts" and "almost
certainly the smartest man that has ever lived" -- their words, not mine.)

It went something like, "Well, people who brag about their IQ on the internet
are narcissists, who have nothing worth bragging about *except* their
intelligence. That's why they're so off-putting."

Except narcissts aren't off-putting. Not at first, anyways. According to [Back et
al.](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/98/1/132/), "Narcissism leads to
popularity at first sight." [Holtzman and Strube](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656609002177) confirms, "A meta-analysis (N > 1000) reveals a small but reliable positive narcissism–attractiveness correlation that approaches the largest known personality–attractiveness correlations."

The real reason it's off putting? It's probably false. The probability that someone is
wrong about their IQ is, I'd estimate, at least one in four. They might have taken
some fake online test, "misremember" their score, taken it at the age of
seven, that sort of thing. Or, you know, they could be *lying*. 

The distribution of pathological liars in the general population is not
clear. [Wikipedia suggests 1 in 1000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudologia_fantastica#Epidemiology)
among repeat juvenile offenders, but given the prevalence of other mental
illnesses -- psychopathy at 1 percent and depression at 7 percent -- I expect
that's a lower bound. 

So, I guess what I'm saying is, **these days, when I come across an unbelievable story on the internet, I try not
to believe it.**
