You get to choose what to believe. If you want to believe that you can fly, you
are free to believe that. Reality, however, is a hostile place. It does not care
about what you believe. 

Jump from a cliff and you will not fly, no matter how much you wish it to be
so. Beliefs do not change what *is*. They do not change what is *true*. You can
choose to believe true things or false things, but your belief does not change
what is *real*, what is *actual*.

If you choose to believe only nice things, you will end up believing many false
things. Reality is not nice. There are not only nice things out there in the
world. While the idea of an eternal afterlife is nice, the niceness of the
idea says nothing about whether or not it is true. It would be nice if serial killers were
just pretending and their supposed victims actually went to live in the tropics,
but this doesn't make it so.

I don't mean only to attack nice beliefs as false. The opposite holds as
well. Something that is painful to think is not true just by virtue of being
painful to think. Negative, pessimistic beliefs are not true because of their
negativity. They are true if and only if they correspond to reality. Gary
Kasparov might think to himself, "I'm no good at chess," and he might feel bad
after thinking it, but that doesn't make it true.

What is real, what is actual, what is true, all of these things are already
so. You can believe whatever you like, but this doesn't change what is already
so. When people believed that the sun rotated around the earth, this didn't make
it so. Belief is a choice, but truth is not. You don't choose what is true. It
has already been decided. Belief feels like a choice because it is a choice, but
do not confuse belief with truth. Believing something does not make it so. Truth
already *is*.
