From Luke's [recent interview](http://intelligence.org/2013/12/13/aaronson/) of Scott Aaronson (theoretical compsci guy at MIT, who blogs [here](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/)):

> Things like linear algebra, group theory, and probability have so many uses throughout science that learning them is like installing a firmware upgrade to your brain — and even the math you don’t use will stretch you in helpful ways.
