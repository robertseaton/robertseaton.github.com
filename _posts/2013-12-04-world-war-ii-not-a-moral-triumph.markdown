title: "World War II: Not a Moral Triumph"

I've started reading through some of the works of
[Mencius Moldbug](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/). I figure that
politics is a waste of cognition but, hey, it's entertaining and I enjoy being
exposed to different points of view. Moldbug is a bit long-winded (understatement), but the guys at More Right have put together [PDF
copies of the "essential Moldbug,"](http://www.moreright.net/books/Mencius%20Moldbug/)
which makes reading it a whole hell of a lot easier. 

I guess I better set this up. Mencius has been churning out millions of words
criticizing progressivism, a movement which is perhaps best exemplified by the
[drivel that gets thousands of upvotes on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/top/). It's
the sort of political ideals embodied by academia and all those who describe
themselves -- without a hint of self-loathing -- as an intellectual. 

Anyways, I've been reading through Moldbug, and was struck by [a passage](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/04/open-letter-pt-2-more-historical.html) where he points out an important
piece of unquestioned and no doubt revisionist history: World War II was a
struggle of good versus evil and good won. The popular narrative goes something
like, "Hitler was an evil man, committing gross human rights violations by
rounding up and slaughtering Jews. The Allied Axis wouldn't stand for this, so
we put a stop to it."

But this ignores:

* Stalin was on our side, and ["it was Stalin, not Hitler, who initiated the
  first ethnic killing campaigns in interwar Europe."](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/mar/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/)
* Stalin killed a comparable number of people to Hitler, but
it's much more socially acceptable to be a Communist than a
Nazi.
* Roosevelt maintained a
  ["policy of cooperation"](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/mar/21/could-stalin-have-been-stopped/)
  with Stalin. How would you feel if the United States had maintained a policy
  of cooperation with Hitler while he was exterminating the Jews? Would that
  have been a moral triumph?
* *The New York Times*, the most popular newspaper during the war,
   [systematically buried stories about German atrocities against Jews](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buried_by_the_Times).
  
Makes you wonder about [this whole moral progress thing](http://paulgraham.com/say.html).
