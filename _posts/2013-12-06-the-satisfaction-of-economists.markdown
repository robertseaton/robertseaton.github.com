Tyler Cowen has written
[a post](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/12/the-happiness-of-economists.html)
on [a paper](http://econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/88111/1/772165831.pdf) about the
life satisfaction of economists. It's a horrible paper. I don't like it at all.

Here are some reasons:

* The authors use satisfaction and happiness interchangeably. [They are not the same
  construct](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006806601848#page-1) and it will confuse those not familiar with the existing literature.
* The sample is taken from a few mailing lists of European economists.
* The study measures life satisfaction with a single question.
* The life satisfaction question is part of a broader survey focused on
  scientific misbehavior, which means that such information is going to be
  primed before the life satisfaction question. 
* Meditation: Imagine that you conduct two studies: one in which you ask participants to reflect on all
  the good things that have happened to them in the past three months, followed
  by a life satisfaction question, and one in which you just ask them about life
  satisfaction. Is there a difference?
* I remain unconvinced that numeric ratings of life satisfaction can be
  meaningfully compared across populations. [The French rate themselves as less
  healthy than Americans, but live an average of 3 years longer.](https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/Living_DK_JR_2005.pdf)
  
Still not convinced? [The Maasai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasai_people)
are a semi-nomadic African people in Kenya and
[the average Maasai is as satisfied as the economists in this study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-005-5683-8#page-1).
