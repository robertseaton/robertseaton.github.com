Pop quiz. Who's more likely to initiate a break-up? Men or women?

Okay, okay. You read the headline. The answer is women. **Women are more likely
than men to initiate a break-up.** 

> First, men are less likely than women to initiate break-ups (Hegelson, 1994;
> Hill, Rubin, and Peplau, 1976), and noninitiators of a break-up are more
> likely than initiators to experience distress (Sprecher, Felmlee, Metts, Fehr,
> & Vanni, 1998).

But what's the effect size, I can hear you shout. I don't know because both
papers are paywalled.

Which sex suffers more from a breakup? Men or women?

> Exploratory data analyses revealed that **women more than men reported
> experiencing negative emotions after a breakup,** particularly feeling sad,
> confused, and scared.

But not so fast! From the same paper:

> Previous research using various inventories of emotions suggests that **women
> experience more positive valence emotions and less initial distress** following a
> breakup than men (Choo, Levine, and Hatfield, 1996; Hill et al., 1976; Sprecher,
> 1994; Sprecher et al., 1998).

If I want to abuse the evo-psych habit of fabricating [just-so stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story), I can
reason:

* Women suffer more because it's harder for them to find a committed man than
  vice versa.
* Men suffer more during a break-up to signal emotional involvement plus commitment which,
  ideally, halts the process. ("All this pain proves I love you! Don't leave me.") Thus their
  distress is greater and it's *all part of evolution's depraved plan*.
  
Symmetrical to that second point, I'd expect women to
escalate sexual commitment if their long-term partner starts sending
I'm-thinking-about-leaving-you vibrations.

Buss anticipates my second point and writes:

> Because women value emotional commitment so highly in their mates, men may
> deploy a counter-strategy to exploit this desire: he may attempt to maintain
> sexual access to a woman by signaling an increase in his emotional investment to
> her. In the modern world, men can accomplish this by suggesting they become
> exclusive to one another, cohabit, obtain a mutual pet, get married, or have
> children. 

How romantic! Thanks evolution.

Right, but as I was going to say -- before being distracted by Buss and Perilloux's paper
-- this first result makes a lot of sense if you already know that [women initiate 70%
of all divorces](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/homo-consumericus/201311/are-men-or-women-more-likely-file-divorce). So
it's nice to see that this trend isn't some strange artifact of marriage and
holds for romantic relationships generally. 

Last fun thing. If you dump a woman, yeah, she's gon' be mad:

> Davis et al. (2003) found that women who did not initiate the break-up
> reported more anger, hostility, and violence directed at their partner than
> did men.
