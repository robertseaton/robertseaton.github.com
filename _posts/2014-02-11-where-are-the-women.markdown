description: "A critical look at the popular narrative of sexism in tech."

It has become fashionable as of late for media outlets like Gawker and others to
criticize Silicon Valley, math, computer science, and the hard sciences generally
as being unfriendly to women. This does not strike me as much different
than the bullying of the math and computer nerds during high school, except now
we've exchanged jocks for journalists, and it's covered in a not-very-convincing
veneer of social justice-y
but-we're-bullying-nerds-because-oppression.

The most convincing challenge to this narrative was written by [Scott
Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com/) in [a comment](http://www.benkuhn.net/inclusivity#comment-333), which was a response to many other specific concerns not
likely to appeal to most readers. I'm reproducing the relevant bits here in an
attempt to, well, fight obscurity with a little less obscurity.

careers. They're paid by the click and not paid well."
