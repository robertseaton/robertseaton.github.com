title: The Stark Beauty of the Glazed Donut
layout: post

The glazed donut is the noblest of all donuts. It's not a loud, flashy
donut. It doesn't seduce coffee house denizens with sprinkles or jelly
filling. It's an honest, functional donut. While all donuts may represent some excess, the glazed
donut does not smack of the same gluttony as more lavish donuts. 

The glazed donut is to donuts as black coffee is to coffee. It's a man's
donut: a plain, frill-free donut. It's a white t-shirt, not a lacy dress.
