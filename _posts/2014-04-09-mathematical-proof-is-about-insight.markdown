title: Mathematical Proof Is About Insight

Tyler Cowen [pointed](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/04/are-computer-coming-up-with-answers-we-cannot-understand.html) me to [an article](http://io9.com/computers-are-providing-solutions-to-math-problems-that-1525261141/all) on automated theorem proving. Namely, a
computer "has solved the longstanding [Erdős discrepancy problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%B11-sequence#Erd.C5.91s_discrepancy_problem)!" This would not
be such a big deal, except the 13 gigabyte proof is too complicated for anyone to
understand. 

So, of course, the Boeotians are in rare form as the clack of
keyboards fills the metaphorical air in an attempt to sate the internet's
endless appetite for stupidity. Or: people are saying some really dumb stuff.

The discussions tend to anchor around trust. Can we trust the computer? What if
there was a bug in the software? Gil Kalai, a math professor at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, said, "I'm not concerned by the fact that no human
mathematician can check this, because we can check it with other computer
approaches."

The mistake here is to assume that mathematics is about
proof. It's not. Proof is a means to producing insight, and a proof that no one
can understand is close to worthless.

But don't listen to me. Take it from Fields medalist
[Bill Thurston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston). He wrote a paper
["On Proof and Progress in Mathematics."](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236v1.pdf)
It has profoundly influenced my ideas
about what intellectual enterprise and mathematics particularly are about.

Or as Richard Hamming put it, "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers."
