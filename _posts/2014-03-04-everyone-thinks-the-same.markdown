On May 7th of 1997, Garry Kasparov -- the [second strongest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_top_chess_players_throughout_history) chess player of all
time -- was hunched over a chess board. Both of his elbows
rested on the table in front of him, with one hand clutching his forehead. His
face sported a look of the purest determination. 

His opponent felt nothing. It was Deep Blue, a machine built by IBM and, at the time, the
most powerful computer chess player in existence.

The match ended in a draw after 56 moves and lasted just over 5 hours, but most notable was Kasparov's opening strategy. He
intended to force Deep Blue out of "The Book" as quickly as possible, in the hope
that human ingenuity would have an advantage over the rigid processing of the
machine.

## Chess and the Book

The [earliest recorded chess match](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chess) dates back to the 10th century, played between
a historian and a student. Since then, it's become a tradition for moves to be
recorded -- especially if a game has some significance,
like a showdown between two strong players. As a consequence, today, students of the game benefit from one of the
richest data sets of any game or sport, with sites like
[ChessBase](http://database.chessbase.com/js/apps/onlinedb/) boasting more than
6 million recorded matches.

These recorded matches are sometimes referred to as "The Book," as in, "He's still
playing from The Book," which means that they're playing a move that has been
played before in the history of recorded chess.

It may not be immediately obvious that there exist chess moves that haven't been
played before. Claude Shannon [famously estimated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number) the number of possible chess
positions at \\(10^{43}\\). That's a whole lot more than the number of atoms in an
apple -- more possible moves than humans can ever hope to play. 

If you wanted, you could go right now and download a chess program, load a few
million recorded matches into it, and check whether or not a move has ever been
played before by another human being. If you were playing against a friend, you
could pull up a computer and compare your own moves to those of other players
throughout recorded chess history -- a sort of thread linking
yourself with someone two hundred years ago.

Human thought is a lot like chess.

## Been There, Thought That

This is a somewhat embarrassing and juvenile admission, but there was an
AskReddit 20 days ago, ["What is something you want to touch more than anything
in the world?"](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1xnas2/what_is_something_you_want_to_touch_more_than/) I tried to come up with something creative, couldn't think of
anything good, and thought, "Welllll, guess I'll go with Scarlett Johansson's
boobs."

I opened the thread and that was the second most popular response. 

Earlier today, Scott
[posed a question](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/03/do-life-hacks-ever-reach-fixation/)
to his readers, "What's a lifehack that everyone uses?" I came up with a few
that I thought were clever -- calendars, clocks, hand-washing, prayer and
meditation. Except when I scrolled through the comments, people had thought of
each of those ideas, along with maybe fifty others.

Another example: during a lull in conversational topics with friends, I sometimes drag problems
that I've been thinking about into the discussion arena -- something like, "What
are the most important things for a man to know?" These are  problems
where I've spent maybe four or so hours working on them, but haven't discovered
anything satisfying. 

These conversations are eerie. I sit and watch people run through thought
processes that I've already had, offering suggestions that I've already
considered, thinking thoughts I've already thought. 

## A "Book" of Thoughts

All of these are cases where someone has either thought something before me, or
I've thought of something before them. These thoughts have been thought
before. This is like  "The Book" in chess. Thoughts
are moves that have been played before.

Sure, we don't have a central repository of thoughts in the same way that there
is a database of chess matches, but we do have all the
words published and indexed by Google on the internet, along with more than 35
million books in the Library of Congress. 

If I want to have a novel thought, to produce some *actual* insight, I'm tasked with trying to think something that a human being has never
thought before. This is not *too* difficult. I can invent a sentence like,
"Imagine a giraffe that's made out of extension cords, except where the plugins
are eels with toothy, human-like grins." This is a novel thought, but that's
about the extent of positive things that one can say about it. It's useless.

Thinking something novel and useful is harder.

## An Algorithm for Thought

The insinuation, then, is that human thought (or reason) is a structured
process. It occurs broadly in the same way across individuals. 

Which is not to say that my
thoughts and your thoughts are identical. Thanks to a variety of genetic and
environmental causes, we run on sorta different hardware, and we each have
absorbed a different knowledge base to reason from.

Still, human thought is surprisingly homogeneous. Often I will make an
observation to a friend or family member and they will say, "That's what I was
thinking." This is a clue that we're all doing the same sort of thing in
our heads. Our thoughts are like water, each drop
tending to end up coursing through the same canyons.

* Why is human reasoning so similar? There are probably universal laws
  of valid
  inference -- [first-order logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic)
  and [Bayesian inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) are
  possible candidates -- which we have evolved towards.
