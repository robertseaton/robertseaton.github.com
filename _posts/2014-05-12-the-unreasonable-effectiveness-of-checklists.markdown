Dr. Peter Provonost had a problem. People were dying and -- to borrow a line
from *Fight Club* -- not in the Sylvia Plath, Tibetan Buddhist, we're-all-dying-so-get-used-to-it
sense of the word. 

No, this is hospital kind of death we're talking. I mean death in all of its
macabre horror. You know, the horror we cover up with euphemisms like "passing away" and pretend
that white sheets and a sterile environment somehow make the notion of oblivion
no longer panic-inducing. *That* kind of death.

And not the inevitable sort. Not of the "his body just gave out" or "there was
nothing we could do" kind of death, although I'm sure plenty of attendings fell
back on that convenient cliche. No, I mean preventable death. Death of
the there-but-for-the-grace-of-unwashed-hands-now-I'm-dead kind. I mean the kind
where you're in the hospital for a routine procedure and some dumbass with 15
years of schooling forgets to wear gloves so now you're profoundly,
absolutely dead. That kind. The
sort of death where if the average doctor had one more percentile of
conscientious you wouldn't be dead because he wouldn't have killed you.

*The sort of deaths that define why hospitals are a dangerous place.*

*That* sort of death was Dr. Provonost's problem. Mistakes were killing people
 at his hospital. Not some podunk care center, either, but critical care at Johns Hopkins. 

So he did the obvious, boring thing. He implemented a checklist for one
basic-but-still-error-prone-and-infectious procedure, inserting a central venous catheter, and everyone had
to follow it. And this checklist of his wasn't complicated. These weren't
instructions where, in order to understand them, you need to rack up the equivalent of the GDP of a small
nation state in medical school debt. There were five
whole things, and they boil down to two: clean yourself and the
patient, wear a mask and gloves. *Not* super tricky,
only-clever-people-know steps.

These were the hospital equivalent of brushing your teeth before bed and
wearing deodorant. The absolute basics. Stuff everyone is supposed to do, but
sometimes people forget. Except when you forget to wear deodorant at a hospital,
it's a lot worse than spending a day fretting over whether or not your crush has
discovered that your natural smell is not coffee-cinnamon-woodland, but
something decidedly *funky*. When you forget at a hospital, someone catches
Legionnaires' disease and dies forever.

And maybe you're skeptical: "A checklist for five things? I can remember five
things no problem. How many mistakes could doctors possibly be making?" (And
that's how I know you're not a programmer.) But you wouldn't be
alone. Dr. Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston [told the
New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/books/24book.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), "It seemed silly to make a checklist for something so obvious.”

Except, you know, this stupid checklist of *five whole things* totally
worked. After a year, the rate of infection on this specific procedure dropped
from 11 percent *to zero*. By two years, it had saved the hospital 2 million dollars, prevented
8 unnecessary deaths, and avoided 43 infections. Consequently, the hospital
implemented still more checklists – reducing the average ICU stay by half and
saving 21 lives.

A [2009 study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa0810119) duplicated
this success in 8 other hospitals: **"its use improved compliance with standards of care by 65% and reduced the death rate following surgery by nearly 50%."**

Checklists are awesome.

### How awesome are they? A brief review

The bulk of the evidence for the effectiveness of
checklists comes from medicine and is relatively recent. While other
disciplines, such as aviation and engineering, have long used checklists, they
*haven't bothered to actually vet that they work*. A [2002 study](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=195135) puts it this
way:

> Aviation safety … was not built on evidence that certain practices reduced the
>  frequency of crashes (but) relied on the widespread implementation of hundreds
>  of small changes in procedures, equipment and organization (to produce) an
>  incredibly strong safety culture and amazingly effective practices. These
>  changes made sense; were usually based on sound principles, technical theory
>  or experience; and addressed real-life problems, but few were subjected to
>  controlled experiments

This is less surprising when we consider *when* the pre-flight checklist was
implemented. They've been a constant in the airline industry
[since 1937](http://www.atchistory.org/History/checklst.htm). 

Even newer and emerging disciplines, like software engineering and
quality assurance, have done little to empirically verify the
effectiveness of checklists. A 2007 paper, ["Best Practices in Code Inspection for Safety-Critical
  Software,"](http://suraj.lums.edu.pk/~cs563/best.pdf) is a typical
  example. Though it focuses solely on the use of checklists to improve software
  quality, it presents no evidence on the actual effectiveness of checklists. 
  
Similarly, a
[1999 review](http://sol.cs.trinity.edu/~thicks/3321/Homework/Code%20Inspection%20Checklists/ACM-Code-Inspection.pdf)
further calls using checklists to inspect software a "best practice," but again
assumes their efficacy.

Reassuringly, though, the evidence from medicine is near overwhelming. Checklists
have been found effective in scenarios as diverse as [oxytocin administration to
pregnant mothers](http://www2.cfpc.ca/local/user/files/%7B7BFB8071-F66B-4988-92EF-B049F500C19E%7D/Checklist-Oxytocin-Maternal%20Fetal%20Outcomes.pdf) (which decreased the rate of cesarean delivery by a quarter),
[actually giving patients medication, measuring lipid levels, screening stroke
patients](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2004/181/8/using-checklists-and-reminders-clinical-pathways-improve-hospital-inpatient-care),
and
[improving the report quality of RCT trials](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2006/185/5/does-consort-checklist-improve-quality-reports-randomised-controlled-trials).

This and more is captured in a
[2012 review and meta-analysis](http://gsresidency.surgery.med.ubc.ca/files/2011/09/Borchard_Schwappach_Barbir_Bezzola_Acute-Care-Surgery.pdf),
which finds that **checklists reduce the risk of mortality by nearly half**: 

> This review shows that with the use of the checklist the relative risk for
> mortality is 0.57  and for any complications 0.63.  
  
It should come as no surprise, then, that checklists are cost-effective, with the ability to save hospitals
anywhere between
[$103,829 and $2,671,253.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3069616/)

If you're still not convinced, not only do checklists save lives and money, but they may also [improve process efficiency and
productivity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3069616/):

> Use of a “preflight checklist” in Kaiser Permanente Southern California’s
> operating rooms resulted in improved nurse retention as turnover decreased
> from 23% to 7%. Also, after implementation of Kaiser Permanente’s checklist,
> there was a decrease in the number of operative cases that were canceled or
> delayed.

So, if the question is "How awesome are checklists?" I'd say: pretty awesome.
