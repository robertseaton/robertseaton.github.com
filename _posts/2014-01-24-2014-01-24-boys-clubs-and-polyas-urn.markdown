I'm not sure whether the two sexes are about to stage World War III over gender
issues or if I'm in some sort of gender bubble but, for whatever reason, I've
been hearing about gender issues daily for the past six or so weeks and, as part of
a gender, I have some thoughts on it. These thoughts revolve around the notion
of boys clubs and general irritation at the idea that I'm somehow in the wrong
for being a manly guy who likes to do manly things, and those manly things
happen to be math and computers. 

You see, friend, I'm part of a number of male-dominated communities, of boys
clubs, and -- to my perpetual dismay -- I find myself surrounded by discussions
where some naive progressive yells something like, "Hey, look at all these men
here. It's all men. Where are the women? Therefore, sexism." And I'm thinking
something like, "Hey, fuck you. I'm not a fucking sexist. Take your agenda
elsewhere and let me read about category theory in peace."

But then I had idea. What if boys clubs are like Polya's urn? And, if you don't
know what Polya's urn is, don't worry, because I'm about to tell you. There's
this urn, right, a big fucking urn, and it's got two balls in it, like one of
those lottery contraptions, a blue one and a red one. Here's the thing about
this urn, though. When you draw a blue ball from it, you have to put two blue
balls back in. When you draw a red ball, you put two red balls back in. 

Now, the notable thing about this urn is that small changes in initial
conditions lead to big changes in the long run. If your first draw is blue, it's
pretty likely that all the subsequent draws will be blue, too.

What if male-dominated sites like, let's say Reddit, are like this? The Reddit founders
were two men, Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman. Given that men are more likely
to have male friends, they're like the balls in Polya's urn. They're in the urn,
convincing a friend to sign up is like picking a ball out of the urn and
throwing two more back in, and Reddit's current male-dominance is the long-run
outcome of this sort of process. Men invite men, therefore men and not
sexism. QED.

Hey, look Ma! My model predicts boys clubs without positing sexism anywhere. 

Or, you know, there's the whole compelling narrative that men and women have different
preferences, with men more likely to be interested in *things*, like computers,
and women more interested in *people*. Oh, and hey, before you go screaming
"But that's sexist. Men and women are the same in every way," here's some [empirical validation with massive effective sizes.](http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/a0017364)
