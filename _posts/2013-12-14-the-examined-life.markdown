> Know thyself? If I knew myself I would run away.
<span id="quote-attribute">—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe </span>

Humans are evolutionary hacks. I'm often not of one mind, or even two, but of
four and sometimes more. Our brains seem to be locked in an eternal struggle, a constant clash of
warring preferences. Consider the would-be comedian who, instead of working on
his act, spends the day watching *Family Guy* reruns. He is of two minds: one
wishes to watch *Family Guy* while another wants to brainstorm new routines.

## Many-Self Model

It's interesting to listen to the way that people use language when talking
about the self. People say things like, "I had to talk myself into
going to the gym." This is a normal phrase. I hear it all the
time. Unremarkable. 

But exactly who is talking to who? The self had to convince the self into doing
something? Or the popular maxim, "Just be yourself." Who else are you going to
be? All self-talk has this sort of strangeness to it. Why would *myself* need to
counsel *myself* about anything? 

[You're a brain](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RufeL9WnXn_eNypki_jtsOQNqusPQTZUBD3s6xrxxJ4/edit#slide=id.i0), but there's not just *one* you, and these many-you are most
evident when they're in conflict. Consider the overweight man who finds himself
in a familiar dilemma: chocolate cake, to eat or not to eat? In one corner, there is a piece of him who wants to eat the
cake. In the other corner, there is a piece of him who wants to lose
weight. The bell sounds. Fight!

Or take creative alarm clocks. There is one, [Clocky](http://www.nandahome.com/products/clocky/), that, like a roomba, moves
about the room while it goes off, so that you have to chase it down in the
morning. There is
[another recent one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alarmclock.xtreme.free&hl=en)
for Android phones that requires you to solve a math problem
before it will stop ringing. A friend told me about this. He said he's been
"using" it, but instead of solving it in the morning, he just turns off his phone.

I've read, too, about people -- adults -- who want to stop biting their nails, so
they'll coat them with something bitter. It doesn't work, though. They just end up finding some clever
way to wash it off. 

I love these because they characterize the [absurdity of the human condition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism). The present-me installs an alarm clock with every intention of
getting up on time, only to be thwarted by morning-me. These two versions of
me might as well be different people, each trying to control the other. Our
experience is
this constant struggle, every part of our brains pulling and pushing us in two
or three or a thousand different directions. 

## Many-Selves and Many-Goals

Imagine that you throw a party for New Year's Eve and, as part of a
game, everyone must write down their resolutions for the incoming
year, which you then combine on one sheet of paper. You then go around and guess which resolution belongs to which person. 

Now, consider the sheet of everyone's goals. There's no reason for them to be consistent with each other. One person might want to save money while
another might want to buy a house.

And that's fine. It's no problem for these people if their goals conflict. They're different
people, each pursuing rapper Gudda Gudda's maxim of ["You do you. I'ma do me."](http://rapgenius.com/Gudda-gudda-100-on-it-lyrics#lyric) It is a problem for you and me, though, because we're a lot more
like a body shared by an entire party of selves (or agents or modules if you
prefer) than one consistent identity. A mind is not one individual, but a society. Our goals are as contradictory as a list
of the goals of a dozen or so people. 

## Explicit and Implicit Goal-Keeping

And our list of woes grows longer, because the type of goals that one is
willing to write on a list are not the same as the desires of each
self inside of us. Our selves have differing time preferences, for
example, some preferring instant gratification while others want to plan
for the future. I would not write "eat whatever takes the least effort to make" on a list of New
Year's resolutions, but you can be damn sure that there's a chunk of my mind
that prefers convenience over health.

The point is that the human mind is complicated,
conflicted, inconsistent, and not so much one unit, but more of a group of
competing modules, and this insight forces us to think differently about our goals.

Maybe this is clearer with a thought experiment. Imagine that you're presented with a genie who is willing to grant
you one wish and you wish for a complete list of your goals. This list is going
to look a whole lot different than a list that you make by sitting down and
thinking about what it is that you want out of life. A list of your explicit and
implicit goals is different than a list of just explicit
goals.

Let's make it concrete. Maybe you're familiar with "[Movember](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movember)," which is where men grow
facial hair during the month of November, in order to raise awareness for men's
health issues, like prostate cancer. This all sounds very nice, yes? But what
does growing facial hair have to do with prostate cancer? Nothing. Raising
awareness about something doesn't do much good at all, certainly not as much
good as a direct donation. It's more about
appearing caring, convincing other people of your virtue, than about actual
helping. Or maybe it's just about funny facial hair. Either way, not about helping.

Most of us carry around this explicit goal of helping people, while the
reality seems to be more sinister. The way we behave seems to be more along the lines of convince-other-people-I'm-virtuous. This is clear whenever some tragedy strikes and my Facebook feed is
filled with people posting "My prayers go out to the families of
those involved." First of all, even under the
assumption that prayers work, there's no reason to post on the internet telling
everyone about you praying and, second of all, prayers might be nice but a five
dollar donation is a lot nicer.

## Knowing Thyself

The point I'm developing, then, is:

* Human value is complicated and often contradictory.
* Our wants and desires are not obvious.

This leads us to the question of: How can we determine what it is that we want?
As a litmus test, do you think an exercise like, "Imagine you're looking back on
your life trying to decide what was important and what wasn't," is going to be
enough to figure out your goals? The answer is no, although
thinking about such a question might give you a starting point.

What we're after, then, is accurate means of understanding ourselves, techniques
that will give us some measure of clarity if it's to be had. We would like to --
where possible -- eliminate reliance on subjective experience and inject a
measure of rigor into knowing ourselves. We'd like some certainty.

### Understanding Why

It's instructive to step back and survey our surroundings. Why does it
matter whether or not we pursue the right goal? There are a whole lot of people
at colleges across the country who are right now cramming for finals. They [are soon going to forget
everything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve). They've replaced the
goal of learning with the goal of getting a passing grade.

We care about pursuing certain goals and not others because some
will better achieve our values -- for the same
reason that we prefer eating cheeseburgers to eating dirt: we like cheeseburgers
and not dirt.

We can continue down the rabbit hole and ask, "Why ought I prefer one thing
to another?" I used to worry about this, but the question is confused. Maybe there is no good reason why
you ought to prefer cheeseburgers to dirt, but it's the case that yous do. Our
brains ensure that we have preferences.

The point of a goal, then, is to achieve whatever it is that these preferences
are. Over the summer, I did a literature review of the current state of
the art of happiness research, because I value happiness. The trouble with the wrong goal
is that it moves us towards something we don't value. It could be the case
that people care not so much about doing good than about
convincing other people that they're good. The two values suggest different
goals. If I want to help people, I could apply for a consultation at [80,000 hours](http://80000hours.org/faq),
while if I want to convince people that I'm a good person, I could work on
becoming more charismatic.

### Values as Bedrock

People, by and large, act as if goals are nebulous things that appear out of
nowhere, as if whispered to them by the gods. Their striving is chaotic,
less the product of thoughtful reflection and more the result of the media's
near constant attack on our senses. 

Consider the man who decides to become a lawyer because he believes doing so
will make him happy. If he had first considered that his ultimate value was
happiness, he might first decide to  research on what it is that
makes people happy and the happiness of lawyers. In the process, he might
stumble on [Forbes reporting "associate attorney" as the unhappiest job in America](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/03/22/the-happiest-and-unhappiest-jobs-in-america/),
and save hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of striving towards the
wrong goal.

The point I'm making, then, is that with an accurate list of your own values, you
can come up with plans for achieving those values. If life has a meaning or
purpose, this is the closest I've come to finding it.

In compelling recipe format, the meaning of life:

1. Know what it is that you want.
2. Plan out the best way to get it.
3. Implement that plan.

Our trouble begins, as I developed earlier, with the first step. It's not
obvious what it is that we want. We need some way to figure it out and, given
that this is the foundation on which any goal is built, it's hard to overstate
the importance of some clarity as to our values.

### Identifying Values

The most direct route to understanding your own values seems to be by figuring
out those of others -- at least in part -- and then assuming that you also
value those things. One example: I don't have much explicit interest
in romantic relationships, but whenever I find myself reading about male-female
mate preferences and [clash-of-the-sexes-type articles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_investment), I notice that I'm
fascinated. Given that most people are interested in understanding the opposite
sex and that millions of generations worth of
evolution has dedicated significant portions of my brain to that task, I find myself forced to
update in the direction that, no, I'm not special snowflake who don't want no
woman. 

In fact, that anecdote has another point. We can often illuminate ourselves by
understanding how evolution has shaped our desires and motives. Indeed, there's no need
to limit ourselves to evolution. Any knowledge that illuminates humankind is
useful in furthering our understanding of ourselves, whether it be neuroscience,
artificial intelligence, psychology, economics, or politics, which is sort of
empowering. There are many routes to self-knowledge.

Given this, what can we say about human values? Well, human universals are
straightforward. Most everyone wants:

* Happiness, positive emotions
* Freedom from pain, good health, and an absence of negative emotion
* Fulfilling interpersonal relationships, romantic and otherwise
* A sense of meaning and purpose in life
* A conviction that our actions make a difference and that we matter
* The respect and admiration of other people
* Personal growth and self-improvement, increases in our own skill and competence

Beyond these, its less obvious. I 
looked over the [New York Times Best Sellers list](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/list.html), but didn't find it all that
illuminating, except I will note that people seem more interested in reading
about "proof" of heaven and history in general that I would have thought.

Some values are more idiosyncratic, though. In psychology, there is a
personality trait of "[openness to experience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience)," which sort of captures how interested someone
is in learning new things, trying new foods, that sort of thing. Creative types
score high on openness and this trait varies among individuals. You probably know
people who are not interested in reading books or any intellectual
pursuits. These people are low on openness.

We could think of this value as "the exploration of one's interest" or the value
of learning about the world. This one is a bit odd because we can ask, "well, do
we really care about the exploration of interests or are we interested in the
exploration of interests as a means to an end?" It's a little bit of
both. Sometimes we're interested in things because of what they can do for us,
but it's also enjoyable in and of itself to explore something
interesting. This could be grouped under "positive emotions" above, but I think
it's a useful distinction. To be fair, I ought to point out that "positive
emotion" and "negative emotion" cover a broad swath of human experience: awe,
excitement, interest, anxiety, sadness, dread, contentment, and more.

But what else do we value and want out of life? In economics, there's this
[notion of signalling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_%28economics%29). You
might volunteer at a homeless shelter not because you care about the homeless,
but because you care about signalling to other people that you're caring. A
fair amount of human activity seems to revolve around *looking good* rather than
anything of substance. Robin Hanson writes
[quite a bit about this topic](http://www.overcomingbias.com/tag/signaling). 

More troubling are those things that we value -- as big, smart monkeys -- that we
aren't "supposed" to value. If you're familiar with Nietzsche, he writes a bit
about the enjoyment of cruelty and vengeance. I'm reminded of a scene from *Conan the Barbarian*, when Conan is
asked, "What is best in life?" He responds, "To crush your enemies, see them
driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women."

In this vein, you'll note that people seem, on the whole, more interested in
winning arguments than getting to the truth of whatever it is that they're
discussing. It's more about domination, more battle than discovery. Winning
battles against opposing tribes is satisfying (politics!) and, while I have never crushed an
enemy -- at least not physically -- I suspect it feels pretty good.

## Stockpiling Self-Knowledge

> To know oneself, one should assert oneself.
<span id="quote-attribute">—Albert Camus</span>

The general undercurrent here, then, seems to be that -- in order to identify
values -- one ought to amass knowledge about oneself and humans in general,
develop a certain sensitivity to what it that people value and desire and an
accurate understanding of our own idiosyncrasies.

I have a couple ideas about how to go about this, but no silver bullet. There is no royal road to self-knowledge. It's hard work.

* Read and learn about different fields that shed light on what it is that
  humans want. There are a lot of possibilities here, as I mentioned earlier,
  from psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, ethics, and more. Really, any
  field that deals with some aspect of humanity has something to offer. ([This](https://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/pronin/pubs/Pronin%202009%20Introspection%20Illusion.pdf)
  looks like a good place to start.)
* Careful observation of ourselves and others. How do we act and feel in
  different situations? What do our actions and words suggest about our goals
  and values? When do we clash with other people? What are others striving for?
  What do people spend money on? Notice what's popular and why. ([Cultivating mindfulness](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html) might be useful for this.)
* It's instructive to consider what chimpanzees want and how humans are similar
  and different.
* Take a different point of view when considering someone. If a stranger did the
  same things that you do, what would you think about them? If someone does
  something that you don't understand, ask why you would do that in their
  situation. Everyone feels normal from the inside.
* Try getting honest feedback from others. What do they think about you? How
  does this differ from your self-concept. [One study](http://psp.sagepub.com/content/25/11/1417.short) found that other people
  were better at predicting the length of a relationship than those in the
  relationship.
* You might try keeping a journal, or any other of the thought experiments that
  people suggest when considering values. What do you want for your children?
  What makes you jealous? All of these suggest possible values. 
* [Some research](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/68/1/36/) suggests if we know about our biases, we may be better able to
  control for them. 
* Reflect. How much would you pay to prevent a chicken from being tortured?
  Would you rather have more technology or less? Would a happiness pill be a
  good thing? Construct counterfactuals and
  [intuition pumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_pump). Ask yourself,
  "Is this my true motive? Is there something deeper here?"
* In an uncertain world, there's a great deal of value in
  preserving your options and hedging your bets. Maybe you don't think you care
  about social status or money, but -- given that there's a not insignifcant chance you
  could be mistaken -- invest in something that's either transferable
  or that will move you towards many different things simultaneously. Paul Graham
  [writes](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html) about majoring in math instead of economics, since a math major can get
  a PhD in economics, but an economics major can't get a PhD in mathematics.
