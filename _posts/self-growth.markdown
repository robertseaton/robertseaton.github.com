What is self-growth? How can we get more of it? Is more self-growth better? What
is it good for? These are the questions that plagued me when I started thinking
about self-growth. When I consider how much I've changed over even the past
year, the change strikes me as good, something that I'd like to have more of. 

# What is self-growth?

If you want to increase the amount you have of something, be it love, happiness,
or self-growth, you need some way to measure it. If not, how are you going to
know whether or not you've gotten any more of it? How are you going to recognize
what works and what doesn't?

The first step to measuring and later cultivating something is to first define
it. We need to understand what self-growth is before we can get more of
it. Otherwise, our efforts at promoting self-growth will end up with results
just as confused as our concept of self-growth.

First, we can note that inherent in the idea of growth is the idea of change. If
a plant looks the same as it did when you last saw it, you would not say that it
has grown. It is the same with a man. If you do not change, you cannot grow.

But there's another facet of growth. You might consider of Ted Kaczynski, a
child prodigy who became the youngest professor ever to be hired by Berkley. He later
matured into the Unabomber. Would we call this growth? It seems more apt to
think of it as a kind of shrinking of the human spirit.

Shrinking is a type of change, too, but it is not a good change. Alzheimer's
patients change dramatically, but they do not grow. Growth is positive change,
while the opposite is more like rot. 

## What distinguishes growth from rot?

How do we know the difference between the current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso,
from Ted Kacynzski? The answer is judgment. We can examine the characteristics
of the two men and then judge which seems more like self-growth.
