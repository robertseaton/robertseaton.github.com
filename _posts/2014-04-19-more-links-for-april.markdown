* Recent welfare reform [has siphoned money](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/04/is-the-safety-net-failing-the-poor.html) from the very poor to the almost-poor.

* Divorce is contagious: [We find that divorce can spread between friends, siblings, and coworkers, and there are clusters of divorcees that extend two degrees of separation in the network](https://www.um.edu.mt/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/126464/breakingupishardtodo.pdf).

* [Why are humans such prudes?](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/05/why_dont_people.html) "Given that studies show that women and men enjoy it (sex) more than most other activities (on average, not on the margin I’ll grant), and given its intrinsically low cost, it appears that even a crude approximation of a utility maximizing person would probably spend much more time having sex than most do."

* Children with Williams syndrome display no racial bias. ["True to form, the control group preferred their own race and gender. The children with Williams syndrome, however, had no racial preference—although they still discriminated by gender."](http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/williams-syndrome-kids-show-no-raci-10-04-13/)

* Genome sequence is improving [faster than Moore's law](http://www.nature.com/news/technology-the-1-000-genome-1.14901#/falling). (HT: [Scott Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com./))

* [Divorce rate among <em>birds</em> depends on the number of available females](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2814%2900260-7): "mate change by pair members and/or breaking of pair bonds by unmated individuals is more frequent when females outnumber males."

* [On the cruelty of really teaching computing science:](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html) "needless to say, refusal to exploit this power of down-to-earth mathematics amounts to intellectual and technological suicide."

Rather, interesting pieces of code are specimens and we are naturalists." (Algorithms seem like a good candidate for interesting specimen.)
