title: The Dumbest Thing That Could Work

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.

The point of the post is this: 
1. **Try the dumbest thing that could work.**
2. **Start experimenting as soon as possible.**

That's it. Now I'm just going to go through examples to hammer the point home.

## The world for a concrete example
### Humans are approximate elephants

How do you train a dolphin to perform a backflip? You reward it for the right behaviors, which reinforces
those, until you can chain it all together and get a backflip.

Thanks to Darwin, we know that humans are animals, too,
and we know that a lot of the infrastructure our minds run on is shared with
other animals. This means that a significant part of what makes you *you* is
also what makes a chimpanzee a chimpanzee.

The takeaway, then, is that humans can be trained in a similar way to every
other animal, with rewards for behavior. That's positive reinforcement.

Okay, so here's the scenario. You want to learn more math and intend to do this through solving math problems. You enjoy this once you get started,
but you're lazy. Your brain protests when you pull out the textbook. It just
wants to watch television. So, you decide
to use positive reinforcement to help reinforce studying behavior.

How do you do it? What reinforcer are you going to use? What are you going to
reinforce? What if you reinforce the wrong behavior? Who's going to dole out the
rewards? Start thinking like this and you will become overwhelmed and
implement nothing.

Try the dumbest thing that could work. Buy a bag of M&Ms and
eat one whenever you solve a problem. If that doesn't work, iterate and try
something different. 

### When dawn breaks, I do too

Getting out of bed in the morning is the bane of humans
everywhere. What's a guy to do? Informed by this post, you know the
answer. What's the dumbest thing that could work? 

Download [one of the dozens of Android alarm clock apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lslk.sleepbot&hl=en) and try
that. If that doesn't work, iterate. Reduce
caffeine in the evening or increase it in the morning (via caffeine pills). Install bright
lights. Fast after dinner. Try melatonin.

### Kasparov ex machina

Want to write a program that plays chess? It's only overwhelming when you're thinking: how can I write a program that wins at chess? Wrong goal! First write a program that
loses at chess every time. It could pick a move at random, or always move a
pawn. Then, iterate from there.

### Tegmark would be proud

Maybe you want to learn more math, but you don't know where to start. Doesn't
matter. Go find a book about math and start reading, or start working through
[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), or watch some video lectures. Don't like it? Find another book or something else. Keep
experimenting.

### Sir-Anki-a-lot

Or it seems like a lot of people have trouble [getting started with Anki](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition). They
wonder: what should I memorize? What should I use this for? It's a hard
question so they get stuck. Waste of time. Just add anything that you want to
remember or learn. Keep adding, keep experimenting. You'll figure out what
works as you go along. 

### Strength, friend

In general, a little bit of data is going to be more enlightening
than just thinking about it. Maybe you want to start exercising more, but you're
not sure whether or not you want to run or lift weights. Go out and start
running. Don't like it? Okay, try something else. 

The alternative is that you spend a bunch of time googling and trying to figure
out which is better for you or which you think you'll enjoy more. Don't worry
about it. Just go try something. See what sticks.
