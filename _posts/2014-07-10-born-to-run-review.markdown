I'm training for a half-marathon. As someone not terribly
athletically gifted, it's been slow-going. Since I was going to spend
the 4th of July weekend on the beach, electronically-secluded, I picked up a
dead-tree copy of the book, *Born to Run*.

I've seen a lot of people transformed into,
well, the sort of runners that run with religious fervor after reading this book and I
thought, hey, if it worked for them, maybe it'd work for me.

Long-time readers will note that this is [far](http://rs.io/2014/04/07/zach-weinersmith-on-reading.html) [from](http://rs.io/2013/12/25/bill-thurston-reading-hard-things.html) [my](http://rs.io/2013/12/22/feynman-on-reading-difficult-things.html) [first](http://rs.io/2013/10/08/heuristics-for-reading-mathematics.html)

plan for this to be the first in a very long tradition of reviewing books, so
stay tuned for more.

## A brief summary of *Born to Run*

*Born to Run's* sub-heading is "A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race
 the World Has Never Seen" and, as a rare example of truth in advertising, this
 is sorta what the book is about.
 
 The book documents Christopher McDougall's (the author) fascination with
 ultramarathoning -- you know, those, uh, eccentric individuals who aren't
 content to run marathons, and instead run 50 or even 100 mile races, the
 equivalent of four back to back marathons.
 
 These are the superathletes mentioned in  "A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race
 the World Has Never Seen" -- distinguished
 ultramarathoners like [Micah True](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_True) and
 [Scott Jurek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Jurek).
 
 And then there's the hidden tribe part. The author's ultramarathoning fetish
 leads him to a semi-mystical people known as the
 Tarahumara, a Native American people who live in the sheltered depths of
 Northwestern Mexico. And they drink pinole, which is like water and toasted
 corn. Which the author thinks is oh-my-god-so-amazing. But I'm pretty sure
 there's a reason it hasn't caught on in the United States and that reason is
 that it tastes horrible. 
 
What's most notable about the Tarahumara is that they've developed a
 culture around ultrarunning, sometimes [running more than 200 miles in one
 session](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarahumara#Athletic_prowess). Or like 7.6
 back to back marathons. Oh, and did I mention that hallucinations are extremely
 common among ultramarathons during a race? Yeah. The
 Tarahumara's name for themselves, Rar√°muri, even translates to "those who run
 fast."
 
 This tradition, plus the mysterious and insular nature of the Tarahumara, well,
 it was Scarlett-Johansson-level-irresistible to Christopher McDougall, so he
 decided to track the people down.
 
 Except they didn't want anything to do with him.
 
 So Chris hunts down this other dude, Caballo Blanco aka Micah True, who tells
 him that he's trying to organize a race. And not just any race. He's going to
 organize a race between these reclusive Native American runners and the best
 American ultrarunners.
 
 Oh, and Chris is going to run it, too. Gonzo-style, he's going to insert
 himself into the action and then write it up.
 
 This is mostly what the book is about, plus:
 * Descriptions of past races Tarahumara have run against outsiders
 * Gratuitous ranting against "big footwear" and how barefoot running is divine truth
 * And a chapter on persistence hunting -- chasing something down until it
   collapses from exhaustion -- and how humans were literally born to run
   (and our running ability explains our evolutionary success, and maybe even
   math, but prahhhhhhh-bably not, if you ask me)
   
## Thoughts

### Endurance running hypothesis

![Picture of Conway's game of life.](/img/game-of-life.png)

I found, and this is reveals more about me than about the book, the chapter on
human evolution and the role that running played in our collective success to be
the most interesting. 

The author argues, fairly persuasively, that humans -- you and me -- were born
to run. That running is our birthright. That humans are to running as rabbits
are to hopping.

The basic idea is that humans are more efficient at cooling off than, say,
antelope and even cheetahs. We may not be as fast as either, but we can maintain
a fast enough pace for a long enough time that humans can run animals to
death. They're sprinters. We're marathoners.

This is the reason, the author argues, that humans out-competed neanderthals and
why leaving the trees and standing tall was an advantage. The book even makes
the point that the only reason that marathon running is so popular is because
it's hardwired into humans -- recreation reveals something about the ancestral
environment, basically. 

This notion that we humans succeeded because of our endurance has been dubbed
["the endurance running hypothesis."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_running_hypothesis)

Now, whether this is true, I have some doubts. Certainly humans are capable of
persistence hunting but, as far as I can tell, very few extant primitive peoples
actually do any persistence hunting, instead preferring to farm, forage, or
hunt-without-running-stuff-to-death. Maybe this is a side-effect of modernity, I
don't know.

However, even if early humans didn't race deer until the deer collapsed, it
still sounds pretty reasonable to posit that humans would jog from place to
place. This is what we see, as far as I know, in some African countries.

So, altogether, I suspect the notion that running is a human universal and core part
of our shared identity is more true than false. 

### Barefoot running

Parts of the book read like an extended advertisement for barefoot running --
except I'm not sure what there is to *sell* about barefoot running. Maybe the
author is short Nike stock or something.

But, really, these are the most distracting and annoying bits of the book. The
author has found religion, and it's barefoot running. Okay. I got it the first
time. Maybe he could have mentioned it twice. Twice is alright. Maybe someone
missed it the first time.

Or, hell, just break the barefoot running bits into their own chapter. That
might be okay, too, but, as it is, it's just scattered throughout the text, and
not very subtle either. Like if some star athlete enters the narrative, you
know how you're going to know that he doesn't wear shoes? Or that he suffered
*literally worse than Hitler* level injuries and then switched to barefoot and
oh-my-god, they've disappeared? Don't worry, 'cos the author's going to tell
you.

But, I mean, maybe the guy has a point -- shouldn't we have a strong prior that
evolution didn't mess up something as basic as feet? It seems reasonable to me,
except that now we walk on concrete, which isn't present in the ancestral
environment. But that's not really strong counter-evidence because, as far as I
know, we don't have any evidence that shoes are that great. Plus I think we
should have a pretty fucking serious barefoot prior. 

So even if we did have evidence for shoes, we should still be like, "Yeah, but
evolution. Checkmate, shoe-wearers."

So maybe the author is right, but this is still the most annoying part of the
book.

### Positive stuff

The book is very well-written. I don't know how much you can
really say about a 100-mile race, but the author manages to make the sections
describing ultra-marathons not only entertaining, but compelling -- who's going
to win? Will they get injured, or not?

In fact, the author sometimes pushes too far in that direction, to the point where I
have to expect exaggeration: was so-and-so *really* that attractive? Or is
Mexico *really* that dangerous?

But, on the whole, the author's enthusiasm for the sport is infectious, and I
find myself with something new that I'd like to do before death takes me: run an
ultramarathon. (But, given that I can barely run for 5 minutes without stopping,
it's going to be a while.)

## Should you read this book?

There are a few groups of people that I feel confident recommending this to. You
should read this book if:

* You're already someone who self-identifies as a runner.
* You would like to be more enthusiastic about running.
* You don't have a regular exercise routine.

Originally, I was going to just recommend this to people in the first two
groups but, on reflection, those in the last group have the most potential
upside. Maybe you get hooked on running and, as a result, you don't get heart
disease. That seems like a pretty big win. Exercise in general is a big win, and maybe
you're just not inspired. Sounds reasonable. Maybe this book is *the one* that
sets you on your Destined Path as an ultramarathoner. 

Hell, the first time I realized that I could be an active person was while
reading a biography of Bobby Fischer, of all people, who was apparently quite
the sportsman, you know, physically, as well as on the chessboard.

Those are the people who will really benefit from reading this. Or maybe if
you're one of those people who enjoys the writing style that is best-selling
non-fiction. I don't know who you are, but I know you're out there.

I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the book was a good purchase: the tips I
picked up on proper running posture were worth the sticker price alone. The
entertainment, additional enthusiasm for the sport, and interesting facts were
really just surplus value after that.

So, if you want to pick up a copy, or read more reviews, [check it out on
