title: Don't Think and Drive

What's more dangerous: texting and driving or talking on a headset and driving?

If I told you that texting and driving was more dangerous, I predict you'd say, "Well,
duh. That's obvious. Everyone knows that." But what if I told you the opposite?
Would you say the same thing?

Well, you don't need to, because [some joker at *Scientific American*](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/readers-respond-to-why-brain-prefers-paper/) has done
it for you:

This kinda thing gets my blood pressure up. Researchers report something
unexpected and then people say, "Well, duh. Everyone knows that!" Except they
would produce the *exact same response* if the researchers had found the
opposite.

I can invent explanations for anything, but I don't mistake my brain's
fairy tales for reality.
