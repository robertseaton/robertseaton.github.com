title: Intuition for Epsilon-Delta Arguments
layout: post

There's a [nice question on MathOverflow about the mental experience of mathematics](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/38639/thinking-and-explaining). I tend to lean heavily on bodily sensations of motion
and mental imagery when working on something mathematical: stretching,
compressing, and movement. Proofs and algebraic manipulation often seem like
a sort of flowing.

But, anyways, here's an excerpt from one of the responses that I think is particularly
valuable:

> One specific mental image that I can communicate easily with collaborators,

>  theoretic terms. Do we need to show that for every epsilon there exists a
>  delta? Then imagine that you have a bag of deltas in your hand, but you can
>  wait until your opponent (or some malicious force of nature) produces an
>  epsilon to bother you, at which point you can reach into your bag and find the
>  right delta to deal with the problem. Somehow, anthropomorphising the "enemy"
>  (as well as one's "allies") can focus one's thoughts quite well.
