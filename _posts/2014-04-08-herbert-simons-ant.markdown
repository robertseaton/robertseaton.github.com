title: Herbert Simon's Ant

Here's a metaphor that comes to me by way of Nobel laureate and Turing award
recipient [Herbert Simon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon). 

We can imagine being on the beach and watching an ant. It's path
looks complicated as it zigs and zags to avoid rocks and twigs. Very reminiscent of
complex behavior -- what an intelligent ant!

Except an ant is just a simple machine. It wants to return to its nest,
so it starts moving in a straight line. When it encounters an object, it zigs to
avoid it. Repeat until the destination is reached.

Trying to simulate the path itself would be difficult, but simulating the ant is
easy. It's maybe a half-dozen rules.

The point of this parable is to illustrate the interaction between the
environment and perceived complexity. Lots of complex looking things are really
the result of the territory, the shape of the beach, and not the agent, in
this case, an ant.

But, of course, with this metaphor, I'm not really talking about ants. I'm
talking about people. How much of the complexity of human behavior is
really the product of the environment?

Consider
[yesterday's post](http://rs.io/2014/04/07/zach-weinersmith-on-reading.html). Zach
Weinersmith wrote this about writer's block:

Now, what's so interesting about this? Well, it's a lot like that ant. Humans
can't just sit and intuit something complicated -- we have to go and engage with
the complexity of the environment.
