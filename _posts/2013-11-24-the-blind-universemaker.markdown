Imagine that there are many universes, not just the one we live in, and that
they can reproduce; that one universe can have many children. If there is some
mechanism that universes can use to pass on their "genes," we would expect
universes to evolve.

Think of it this way. Say we start with two universes, one who births four
universes and one who births twelve. These universes would in turn reproduce,
passing on some of their "genes." The very fertile universes would in turn produce
many fertile children who would produce many fertile children and so on, until
most of the universes are very fertile universe.

Or, to put it in terms of humans, imagine a world where stupid people have many more
children than smart people and that stupid people tend to have stupid
children. Given that this is the case, the earth will soon come to be populated
by stupid people.

This idea was proposed in 1992 by Lee Smolin, who speculates that universes
reproduce via black hole formation; each black hole contains the seed of a new
universe. If this is the case, we would expect that most of the universes in the
multiverse are fertile ones, ones selected for black hole formation. Thus this
theory is pseudo-testable. If it's true, we would expect our universe to be
tuned for black hole formation.

This speculative theory leads to the intriguing hypothesis that intelligence is
selected for because it somehow aids black hole formation. Maybe the reason that
we look up into the night sky and fail to observe alien life monopolizing the
universe's resources is that they're busy producing black holes.

also a book on the theory called *The Life of the Cosmos*.
