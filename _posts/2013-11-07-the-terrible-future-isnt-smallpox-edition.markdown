title: The Terrible Future Isn't, Smallpox Edition

The annals of history are strewn with smallpox-infested corpses. The idealist
thinks, "Ah, the past. What a barbaric era!" The cynic thinks, "Open your eyes. We have traded
smallpox for the horrors of HIV/AIDs." 

To which we respond, as always, show me the numbers: smallpox killed an
estimated
[one-third to one-half a billion people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox),
while
[AIDs has killed 30 million people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_HIV/AIDS),
a tenth as many. Terrible-future proponents would be better off scaring
children with scenarios where tobacco use doesn't peak and fall off in the
developing world (India, China, and others) like it has in the USA, in which case we could see staggering
death tolls, with one [WHO report projecting as many as a
billion tobacco-related deaths](http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_full_2008.pdf)
by the end of the century.
