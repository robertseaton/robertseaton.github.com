title: Compressing Knowledge

I wrote a couple of days ago about how we can think of [humans as agents who take
in information from the environment, compress that information, and then store
it in long term memory](http://rs.io/2014/02/22/ju%CC%88rgen-schmidhuber-creativity.html). I argued that interesting knowledge is knowledge which
improves our ability to compress other knowledge -- interestingness signals something is an upgrade to our compressor module.

With that in mind, consider what [John Baez recently had to say about his
research habits](http://intelligence.org/2014/02/21/john-baez-on-research-tactics/).

John follows this up with an example out of algebraic topology, a field (pun
intended) which I know nearly nothing about and could not follow. The gist seems
to be, though, that a whole lot of knowledge is a special case of other, more
general knowledge (at least in mathematics), and by climbing Mount Abstraction we can compress old knowledge.

## Tools for Compressing Knowledge

I have a head full of junk -- disconnected facts, half-baked social theories,
psychological studies, programming trivia. It would be very nice indeed if this
were all organized around some core guiding principles -- if it were a beautiful
graph of knowledge, spreading out in every direction, tended like a
self-organizing garden, refactoring and elaborating itself. How could I go from
the current mess to something more like that?

Well, we can imagine a body of knowledge as a literal body, a corpse. We want to figure out the
bones of that knowledge, the deep structure, and hang the rest of it -- the
facts or "flesh" -- on it. The trick to getting at such a
skeleton, or building your own, is to seek models. Mental processes,
for instance, can often be understood in terms of computation -- like when I
speak of [habits as cache lookups](http://rs.io/2014/02/08/habit.html).

Then, when new information comes in, one can hang it on an already built
skeleton -- connect it to what you already know. John suggests comparing and
contrasting different phenomena as a means of compressing his own knowledge.

The effectiveness of both of these techniques -- connecting and contrasting --
may be a side-effect of the benefits of translating knowledge into new, novel
forms.

If translation is a component of compressing knowledge, a cheap way to implement
this would be to transform ideas into words, writing. Consider how much of the
scientific process centers around writing -- authoring books, papers, taking notes. Is there
evidence to suggest that writing facilitates knowledge compression? K. Anders
Ericsson's landmark paper, ["The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition
of Expert Performance"](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice%28PsychologicalReview%29.pdf) supports such a view:

We might suspect that writing is so effective because it forces knowledge to be
retrieved and then restructured, sort of like taking iron ore, heating
it, and then reworking it. Sounds a lot like compression, huh?

We can understand the benefits of creating and contrasting analogies through
this notion of translation. After all, what is an analogy except a mapping -- a
translation -- between two separate phenomena?

What I'm suggesting then, all together, is that knowledge compression can be
understood as a process through which one takes dormant knowledge and transforms
it. Among eminent scientists, this transformation has typically taken the form
of writing with the intention of revealing the bones of some phenomena --
discovering its skeleton. We need not limit this
process of transformation to the written word, though. Transformation happens
when translating an idea into mathematics, a computer program, drawing, music,
or when attempting to teach it to another. (I know Dan Dennet writes
about the benefits of explaining his ideas to bright undergraduates.)

In terms of subjective experience -- what it's like inside our mental workspace
-- we can think of it as the recall and then reinterpretation of a piece of
knowledge. This reinterpretation need not be radical -- it could be as simple as
connecting two pieces of heretofore separate ideas, like [compressibility and
beauty](http://rs.io/2014/02/21/problem-solving.html),
[problem solving and graph search](http://rs.io/2014/02/21/problem-solving.html),
or [penalties as costs for implementing certain strategies](http://rs.io/2014/01/08/rules-are-rules.html).

The general, compressed principle, then is: **to compress knowledge, recall that
information (drag it into consciousness) and think about that information in some
novel way.**
