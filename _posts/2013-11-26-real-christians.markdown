I have spent the past couple of weeks spending 15 minutes chunks on Reddit,
leaving when I become disgusted enough to get back to working through my topology
textbook. The experience has, however, been enlightening insofar as it sheds
light on the opinions of the masses. Hence, this post.

Discussions will often go something like this: some religious group deviates
from Reddit-brand progressivism (which is almost a caricature of the United
States left). Then, some commenter denounces them as not a real Christian and
receives several hundred upvotes. The Westboro Baptist group, infamous for
protesting funerals, is a common punching-bag in these discussions.

Now, I hope the brain damage here is already evident, but the reasoning seems to
go that *real* Christians cannot believe anything that the typical Redditor finds
morally repugnant. Otherwise, they're not following Jesus! If it's not my
personal brand of Christianity, then it's not Christianity.

You'll often see something like, "Any real Christian supports equality for
gays," but let's be honest here. The Bible's position on homosexuality is about
straightforward as these things get. So, if you're going to argue that the One
True Christianity supports homosexuality, you'll find yourself scrambling
for justifications as to why certain parts of the Bible don't count.

But such an enterprise is circular. People who are arguing
about what makes a real Christian are not interested in what the Bible says. It's rhetoric. They're interested in picking and
choosing pieces of the Bible that support the belief system that they already
have in place.

How do people construct their initial belief system, the one they're using
to fence off the real Christians from the fake ones? Through osmosis. It's a
patchwork of influences of peers, parents, the media, etc. The user who
writes, "Not a real Christian!" means something more like, "Boo! Not a
member of my tribe!" and is not making a point about what does or does not make
a Christian.
