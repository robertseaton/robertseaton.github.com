<span id="quote-attribute">â€”Morpheus, <em>The Matrix</em></span>

Ted is 23, fictional, and one night stays up late browsing the web. He starts on Wikipedia, finds himself reading the page on
the [9/11 terrorist attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks), follows the links to conspiracy theorists, and
eventually lands on YouTube. He watches videos all night. His brain stews
in the information. 

The sun rises. He's convinced. 9/11 was an inside job.

But Ted has a problem. If 9/11 was an inside job and anyone with an internet
connection can find out the truth, why are so few people believers? It's
unlikely that Ted just happens to be one of the select few that has figured out
the truth. He needs some sort of justification. In general, weird beliefs are
wrong beliefs, so why isn't this weird belief wrong?

Ted stumbles around for a while, grasping at nothing, until... Eureka! No
one else realizes the truth, he thinks, because the truth is so horrible. Our *own government*
was in on it. Ted figures that he can see the truth because it's his nature not
to shy away from the painful things in life. He's a stoic, don't-you-know.

Except 9/11 wasn't an inside job. Ted's belief system has been poisoned. 

# Swallowing the Red Pill

I've heard this phenomenon described by adherents of outside-normal beliefs as "swallowing
the red pill" -- like when Neo accepts Morpheus's offer and realizes he's been
living inside of the matrix. 

It's rhetoric. Sure, there are terrible truths about human existence, but:

* [Something that is painful to think is not true by virtue of being painful to think.](http://rs.io/2013/09/28/choice-and-belief.html)
* Too much emphasis on the negative aspects of *something* blinds people to the
  complexities of that something.
  
Regarding my second point, consider the worst of the pick-up movement. They took something with a kernel of truth -- that women find
dominance behavior attractive -- and expanded it into a *philosophy*.

The trouble with that, of course, is that it misses out on all the complexity of relationships -- you know, the whole reason why
you might want a significant other in the first place. Social interaction isn't zero sum. Both parties can benefit more by cooperating than they would otherwise. 

All of this is to say: **If you stumble on some group of people that claim to
have recognized a terrible truth that no one else can bear, beware nonsense.**
