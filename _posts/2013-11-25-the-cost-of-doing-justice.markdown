You've been called for jury duty and you're sitting in on a murder trial. The
evidence is strong and you feel that, even after correcting for overconfidence
and coming at the issue from every possible point of view you can think of,
there's a 99 percent chance that "he done it."

Is 99 percent confidence enough to send a man to prison for the rest of his
life? What if it's a death penalty case? Then how much evidence do you need? I
suspect, for most, 99 percent sounds pretty good. It sounds
like enough to put a man in prison or even sentence a man to death. 99 percent
is beyond a reasonable doubt.

But, of course, it's never that simple and, like the quote above, there will be
intelligent-but-confused people who will claim that one needs absolute certainty
in order to sentence a man to death. You need to be 100 percent certain, or else
you must vote not-guilty.

They have a point. After all, on the scale of
bad-things, sending an innocent man to his death is up there: worse than cheating on your husband, but not "literally worse than
Hitler." It's easy to imagine standing before Saint Peter at the pearly
gates, and Saint Peter going through the list of your sins and saying, "Oh, yeah, [Troy Davis was innocent](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executed-possibly-innocent), and section 3.a.III.j of
the Heavenly code says that sentencing an innocent man to death is
unforgivable, unless you're a 7th Day Adventist. Tell Judas I said hey,"
because, you know, heaven is full of bureaucrats and what-do-you-know, now
you're spending eternity in hell.

But these people are confused. There is no absolute certainty. There's always some absurd, highly improbable way in which you might
be wrong about everything. When people say that absolute certainty is necessary for
sentencing a man to death, they really mean that you need to be closer to 99.999%
certain than 99% certain of guilt in a death penalty case. If someone insists on
absolute certainty of the 100% variety, no one can be convicted of
anything. We'll have to let all prisoners go. There's that one in a
trillion chance that everything you think you know is the product of a vast
conspiracy, like in the movie *The Truman Show*.

All is not lost, though. Presumably, people don't care so much about absolute
certainty, but rather about not convicting people of crimes they did not
commit. You don't have to be absolutely certain, just certain enough that only
criminals go to jail.

How certain do you need to be to prevent an innocent man from being imprisoned?
What about 99 percent? Well, that doesn't work because, on average, one out of a
hundred prisoners is going to be innocent and, remember, our goal is no innocent
people in prison whatsoever.

We want a level of certainty such
that, given all of the people in the prison system, we can be confident that
none of them are innocent. As of 2011, there are 2,266,800 adults incarcerated
in the United States. With a bit of math, we find that even if, on every single
trial, the jury was 99.999956% (1 in 2,266,800)
certain of the defendant's guilt, there's a 37% chance that at least one
innocent man will be sent to prison. 

Now, I don't know if you've ever met a human before, but none of them are
99.999956% right about anything. There is no way for someone to reach
that level of certainty in every single trial. It's an unpleasant truth that
it's more-or-less impossible to prevent innocent people from being
convicted. 

Instead, it's a tradeoff. If we only require 85% certainty before convicting
someone, more innocent people go to prison, but we also catch more guilty
people. Or we can push the necessary evidence in the other direction: if we want
99% certainty, fewer innocents will go to prison, but more criminals will
walk. The only possible system where no innocent men go to prison is one where
no one at all goes to prison.

But despair not, gentle reader! There is hope yet on the horizon. Why is it wrong to send innocent people to
prison? Because it leads to suffering. The wrongness of something is decided by
the amount of harm that it does to the world. While you can't prevent every
innocent person from going to jail, it's within your power to [prevent someone
from dying of malaria](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF). Hell,
a kind word is enough to reduce suffering. The
possibilities for doing good and improving the world are endless, and no doubt
there are easier ways to go about it than fixing the justice system. Go find them.
