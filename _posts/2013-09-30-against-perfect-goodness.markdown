A man who only restrains from murdering people most of the time will not be
considered a good man. He's a murderer, even though he doesn't always murder
the people he meets. Slip up one time and *bam*, you're a murderer. In contrast,
saving one life isn't enough to make a man a saint.

The point is this: in general, to be a bad person, you only have to be
bad some of the time, but to be a good person, you have to be good all of the
time. Consider: you can be regarded as a thief even if you do not *usually*
steal, but to be regarded as an honest man you can never steal. To be faithful
to your wife means that you are faithful all of the time, while you only have to
be unfaithful some of the time to be regarded as unfaithful.

There is an asymmetry here, then. To be good requires perfect goodness, while
being bad does not require perfect badness.

This is absurd. Abandon the notion that you need to be perfectly good all of
the time. It's impossible. You need a healthier relationship with the good or
you'll never be able to think straight. 

What does this have to do with thinking straight? Most people believe themselves to be good people. This is part of their
identity. As I've pointed out above, this entails -- usually implicitly -- that
they are perfectly good, or pretty close. If they are confronted by a new idea
about what it means to be good, then, and they do not conform to that idea, they
will be motivated to reject that idea because it threatens their
self-image.

Let's make it concrete. When I talk with people and point out that a harm of
omission is still a harm, they don't like this at all, even though it's pretty
straightforward. Here are a few scenarios:

* A man is going to die unless you press a button. Is
it good to press the button? 
* A man is drowning. You can save the man. Is it good to save the man?
* A man is starving. You can afford to feed the man. Should you feed the man?
* A man will die of malaria in Africa because he cannot afford a insecticide-treated
  mosquito net. You could, instead of
  spending $20 at Starbucks each week, donate to the [Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF) and save the man. Should you
  save the man?

The answer to all of these is yes. If it's not mind-numbingly obvious to you,
you are confused. Seriously. There's nothing to explain. It's better to save
people than to not save people, even if you have to go without your latte. 

The trouble with allowing for harms of omission is that it doesn't allow you to
preserve the notion that to be good means you are perfectly good. If you define
being good as not actively harming others, being perfectly good is
manageable. If failing to help someone counts as harming, it's
no longer possible to be perfectly good.

Most people respond by arguing against harms of omission. Not
because this is the weak link in the chain, but because it's right there in
consciousness, while intuitive beliefs about goodness requiring perfection are
lurking in the background.

If you abandon the notion that none of us are perfectly good people -- that
perfect goodness is too exacting a standard -- most of the motivation to reject
harms of omission disappears.

Let's go even further. Let's say that to be a good person, you have to be
perfectly good. We then come to a choice: either, you can define good to make
it possible for people to be perfectly good or you can accept the notion that
none of us can be called good. But this is missing the point!

Why do we care about what is good? What's the point
of being good? It's action. It's to go out there in the
world and improve it. It's not about labels. It's not about who's good and who's
bad. It's about helping.

# Further Reading
* The notion that there is an asymmetry between good and bad events is the main
  theme of the paper ["Bad Is Stronger Than Good."](http://www.carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/71516.pdf) I've found it a useful concept
  when thinking about many different things, from blog comments to dog
  training.
* One of the criticisms of utilitarianism is that it's too demanding, that
  no one can live up to its standards. This argument appeals to the intuition
  that to be a good person requires perfect goodness and, as such, perfect goodness must be
  manageable. See
  [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism#It_is_too_demanding) for an overview.
* It also seems a strange criticism to argue that a normative theory is too demanding. The rules of multiplication don't change for large numbers, even though
  humans have a hard time with them. 
* Paul Graham has [an essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) on the
  difficulties of thinking straight about things that are part of your identity.
