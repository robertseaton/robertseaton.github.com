title: Too Smart to Understand

Here is a meme I would very much like to see die forever. I'll be reading book
reviews and come across people gushing about how great the book was -- and they
know it's great because they couldn't understand any of it.

<span id="quote-attribute">â€”from a review of <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again: Essays and Arguments</em></span>

So many 5 star reviews describe a book as incomprehensible. 

I want to shake them. You've been tricked! Intelligence isn't about hiding your
ideas in an impenetrable shroud! It's about laying insights bare so that anyone
can understand them. Great writing is a combination of interdisciplinary mastery
and clarity.

Where do people get this notion of intelligence-as-obfuscation from, anyways?
