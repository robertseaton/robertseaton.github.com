From most recommended to least (roughly):

* The movie *Manufacturing Consent* details Noam Chomsky's criticism of the media, covering [Indonesia's invasion of East Timor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor) and media bias generally. Highly recommended. Much more balanced than his written work.

* ["NSA operation ORCHESTRA: Annual Status Report:"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwcl17Q0bpk) A FOSDEM talk of the form if-I-were-the-NSA-here's-how-I'd-do-it. Foresees the heartbleed bug.

* Alan Kay [talks about *The Inner Game of Tennis*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50L44hEtVos) and quieting the ego in pursuit of learning.

* [Scala vs Idris: Dependent Types, Now and in the Future](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/scala-idris). Idris is sort of Haskell with a stronger type system. Dependent types are a lot more exciting than I thought they were going to be.

* Alex Stepanov and Paramjit Oberoi's ["Programming Conversations"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-meLQaYP5Y&index=2&list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXFAEA-lYoRNQIezL_vaSX-) class. The first three videos (what I've watched thus far) are mostly history of programming stuff.

* [Don Knuth's advice to young people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Ju0eM5T2c) He speaks a bit about his writing process.

* Leslie Lamport's [Thinking for Programmers.](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/3-642) On the importance of thinking through writing specifications (and writing generally).

* [Vi Hart's anti-Pi rant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iUh_CSjaSw) Might be better titled "There's nothing particularly interesting about pi."

* Scott Aaronson's TEDx talk: ["Physics in the 21st Century: Toiling in Feynman's Shadow."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SczraSQE3MY) Sort of "why complexity theory is exciting."

* Simon Peyton Jones's [2007 OSCON talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLj1QV11o9g). He walks through the design of XMonad. 

* [A Possible Future of Software Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4moyKUHApq4): A talk given by one of Adobe's head engineers about their use of generic programming, which is a sort of abstract algebra for algorithms. The idea is simple: identify the most general form of the algorithm and then abstract it out. So concretely instead of writing a sort for each data structures, you write one sort and let it run on all data structures. This is the philosophy of programming being pushed by [Alexander Stepanov](http://www.stepanovpapers.com/), chief architect of the STL. 

* Alexander Stepanov and Paul McJones's [talk at Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9gpJga4Vc) on their book <em>Elements of Programming</em>. You're probably going to need some exposure to abstract algebra before digesting this one. 

* Judea Pearl's Turing award lecture: ["The Mechanization of Causal Inference: A 'mini' Turing Test and Beyond"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNm4nFBFmvo)

* [The architectures of the Utrecht Haskell Compiler](http://vimeo.com/channels/haskell/6681352).
