## Terminology

There are two senses of the word "happiness." The first is the sense of "feeling
happy," happy as a positive psychological state, an emotion, similar to joy. The
other way the word happiness is used is as "he lived a happy life." Happiness in
this way is equivalent to life satisfaction.

It is important to keep these two distinctions in mind as they are two differing
constructs. If an author tries to tell you that income correlates with
happiness, they usually mean happiness in the sense of life satisfaction.

When psychologists write about "subjective well-being," they mean happiness in
both these senses. Subjective well-being is composed of three separate
components: postive affect, negative affect, and life satisfaction.

associated with genetic variation." In contrast, no objective circumstance
considered by the author, such as income
