title: Chicks Dig Veganism
layout: post
---

I recently tried my hand at making
[this](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/vegan-bean-taco-filling/) bean-based, vegan
taco filling (recommended), and
noticed something curious while reading the recipe's comments:

> I made this for my vegetarian daughter and it was so good I served it to the whole family for dinner.

> This stuff is the bomb. Even my carnivore husband loved it!

> My daughter is vegan, while the rest of the family isn't. My husband usually can't stand non meat recipes, and loved this one!

See the pattern? Men are carnivores, women herbivores. This
is from a sample of seven comments. *Half* of the reviews show this
trend. I also have the vague sense that women, generally, are more
interested in veganism and are more open to talking about it. 

And since we live in the future, I don't have to speculate. Are women more likely to be vegans? Yes. There seem to be somewhere between two to
three woman-vegans for every man-vegan.<a href="#citation-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

## Wherefore art thou vegan?

> Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder, "Why, why,
> why?"
<span id="quote-attribute">—Kurt Vonnegut, <em>Cat's Cradle</em></span>

It's interesting in and of itself that women are more likely to be vegans, but *why* are women more likely to adopt a vegan
lifestyle? What motivates these strange, alien creatures? Fellow men, let us
analyze them. Or something. 

By the way, we could reframe this question as, "Why are men not
vegans?" instead of asking why women are vegans. I
suspect that each frame suggests different answers.

### You wouldn't download a steak

<span id="quote-attribute">—Peter Singer</span>

Most vegans adopt a vegan lifestyle out of ethical concerns, or [at least that's
what they report.](http://www.imaner.net/panel/profile.htm) Perhaps women are
the fairer sex, then, and
are more attuned to ethical issues. Or, perhaps women are more attuned to the suffering of animals and, thus, value
reducing it more than men do. This would suggest that women have more empathy for animals or, even, more
empathy in general than men.

Is there any data to support this? Wikipedia's [page on sex differences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans) suggests
that there may be some difference in reported levels of empathy between men and
women. Women also tend to score higher on the Big 5 facet of agreeableness,<a href="citation-16"><sup>16</sup></a>
which can be thought of as a measure of empathy.

If it were the case that women are more ethically minded, I would expect them
to be more likely to be PETA members, veterinarians, more likely to donate to
charity, and more likely to volunteer than men. Is this the case?

### The lady doth protest too much

<span id="quote-attribute">—Henry David Thoreau, <em>On the Duty of Civil Disobedience</em></span>

I can't find any information specific to PETA demographics, but one survey of
animal rights activists reported four women for every man,<a
href="citation-6"><sup>6</sup></a> and women nearly always outnumber men at
animal rights demonstrations.<a href="citation-7"><sup>7</sup></a> The
proportion of female to male members of the American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals is higher than 5 to 1.<a href="citation-7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Further, women are more opposed to animal research than men, and this effect is robust across
nations.<a href="citation-8"><sup>8</sup></a> 

The majority of women in animal rights activism is not a recent phenomena, but dates back to at least 1875 with
the founding of the Victoria Street Society, an early British animal protection
agency, now know as the National Anti-Vivisection Society.<a
href="citation-9"><sup>9</sup></a> Indeed, Victorian women were drawn more to
animal rights than any other cause, except feminism.<a href="citation-10"><sup>10</sup></a>

More, most veterinarian students are women and the proportion of professional women vets is
on the rise.<a href="citation-2"><sup>2</sup></a> Women are also more likely to
donate to charity *in general* and are more generous when doing so, and they are
especially likely to donate to causes supporting animal welfare.<a
href="citation-3"><sup>3</sup></a> According to [this report](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/volun.nr0.htm) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
women are also more likely to volunteer *in general*.

What if we just ask
people how they feel about the ethics of meat-eating or animal suffering? At
least one survey has done so.<a href="citation-5"><sup>5</sup></a> Men were
about 20% more likely to indicate that eating meat is morally justifiable, 72.3% for men versus 54.3% for women. Women were also more likely
than men to express agreement with the idea that food should be prepared in a
way that minimizes animal suffering, 95.1% versus 84.8%.

Men, however, have the dubious distinction of being more likely to actually have sex with
animals.<a href="citation-7"><sup>7</sup></a>

### Is right or left the feminine side?

It's interesting to note that while female philosophers are more likely to specialize
in applied ethics, they are [less likely](http://philpapers.org/surveys/linear_most_with.pl?A=background:gender:female) to switch on the [trolley
problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem#Views_of_professional_philosophers). 
The trolley problem goes like this: there is a train coming down the tracks and it's
going to hit and kill five people. You are standing next to a lever which, if
you pull it, will divert the train. However, the diverted train will kill one
person. Should you pull the lever?

Women failing to switch seems counter-intuitive. If women are more ethical, they ought to
switch on the trolley problem. However, the trolley problem is notable because
it's a problem where intuition clashes with ethics. You can save more lives by
diverting the trolley, but it *feels* wrong. Is there evidence to suggest that
women are more likely to trust their intuitions?

Yes. The Rational-Experiential Inventory measures individual differences in
"faith in intuition," and women generally score higher than men on this
subscale.<a href="citation-11"><sup>11</sup></a> Lay theories of the differences
between men and women reflect the same sentiment. Women are thought of
as "emotional creatures," while men are thought of as cold and
rational (or testosterone-fueled savages). That is: folk psychology posits that women operate on
feelings and intuition. Indeed, the main thrust of the phrase  "in touch with your
feminine side" is about emotion.

We can go further. The MBTI personality scale measures differences (among other
things) in the dimension of thinking versus feeling. Thinking types endorse
statements like, "I make decisions with my head," while feeling types endorse
choosing with their heart. The T/F split is 60/40 for men, while the ratio is
reversed for women.<a href="citation-12"><sup>12</sup></a>

The belief in a god, an enduring human soul, and that prayer affects the world
around us, are all intuitively appealing. To identify as an atheist suggests
that one has discarded these intuitive beliefs. Are men more likely to
be atheists? According to the [Wikipedia page on atheism demographics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism), men are
more likely to be atheists in the United States and the United
Kingdom. Canadian men are also more likely to be atheists than Canadian women,<a
href="citation-13"><sup>13</sup></a> and, in one sample, women held more positive views of
Christianity across age groups.<a href="citation-14"><sup>14</sup></a> Men are
also [more likely to be autistic](http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/autism-and-asperger-syndrome-an-introduction/gender-and-autism/autism-why-do-more-boys-than-girls-develop-it.aspx) and those with high-functioning autism are much
more likely to identify as atheist.<a href="citation-17"><sup>17</sup></a> There is also [more atheism in the natural sciences than the social sciences](http://www.physorg.com/pdf5785.pdf), which tend to be male dominated,<a href="#citation-20"><sup>20</sup></a> although note that there seem to be a disproportionate amount of theists among mathematicians.<a href="#citation-19"><sup>19</sup></a> 

Further, women are more likely to believe in the devil, heaven and hell,
creationism, ghosts, communication with the dead, ESP, and astrology. Men, however, win
out when it comes to belief in aliens.<a href="citation-18"><sup>18</sup></a>

Brain imaging studies further support the notion that utilitarian judgments are
characterized by increased activation of regions associated with deliberative
processing and conflict resolution,<a href="#citation-21"><sup>21, </sup></a> 
<a href="#citation-22"><sup>22</sup></a> while deontological judgments
(e.g. murder is always wrong) are characterized by reliance on emotional
heuristics.<a href="#citation-23"><sup>23</sup></a> It also seems to be the case
that those with weaker empathic responses have an easier time with
consequentialist reasoning.<a href="#citation-24"><sup>24, </sup></a><a
href="#citation-25"><sup>25</sup></a> This suggests that women fail the trolley
problem specifically because they experience stronger feelings of empathy. Men
might outperform women on contrived ethical dilemmas not because they trust
their feelings less, but rather because they experience a weaker, easier-to-override empathic
response.

### Static, dynamic, and sensitive typing

Are women really more sensitive than men?

I've already reviewed a fair amount of evidence that suggests this is the
case. Women are more likely to volunteer, donate to charity, eat in ways
that minimize animal suffering, and so on. This is certainly suggestive of the
idea that women are more empathetic than men.

It's not decisive, though. There could be other reasons why women do all of
these things. Maybe women volunteer more because they don't work as much as men. Maybe women volunteer more because their friends are already
volunteering. It could be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or maybe women
are more likely to say they care about others not because they actually care
more, but because they're more motivated to look good than men are. All possibilities.

One review of sex differences in empathy found that, when study participants are aware that empathy is being measured, women have an
advantage. When studies are more subtle and people are not aware of what is being
measured, the gender differences disappear.<a href="#citation-26"><sup>26</sup></a> A more rigorous meta-analysis by Ickes et al.
replicated this result.<a href="#citation-27"><sup>27</sup></a> The gender
differences in empathy seem to result from differences in the amount of work men
and women put into appearing empathetic. If you pay participants
based on how well they perform at an empathy task, gender differences
disappear.<a href="#citation-28"><sup>28</sup></a> 

It would seem, then, that differences in male and female empathy can be wholly
attributed to differences in self-concept. If we lived in alternative universe
where men were seen as gentle and caring and women brutish and insensitive,
men would score higher on measures of empathy, even if each sex's physiology was
exactly the same as it is in this universe. Women are more sensitive than men
because they try harder at being more sensitive than men.

## Final thoughts

> Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world to rise above.
<span id="quote-attribute">—Rose, <em>The African Queen (1951)</em></span>

I was going to go on and consider differences in eating disorders, disgust
sensitivity, time spent thinking about food, and maybe more, but the evidence
seems overwhelming at this point. I'm convinced, anyways, and it seems
especially inappropriate to continue beating a dead horse in a post about
veganism. Women are more likely to adopt a
vegan lifestyle, at least in part, because the average woman is more likely than
the average man to self-identify as a kind person and, as such, is more
motivated to adopt lifestyle changes in an attempt to reduce animal suffering.
