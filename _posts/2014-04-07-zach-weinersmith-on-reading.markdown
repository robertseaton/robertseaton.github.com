Zach Weinersmith writes
[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](http://www.smbc-comics.com/), my current
favorite webcomic. I wanted to know: Where's this creativity spring from?

Turns out, he reads. A lot.

When asked about his writing process:

> Usually I just read a lot (at LEAST 4-6 hours a day) then sit myself in front
> of a blank google doc and try to write.

Or how to overcome writer's block:

> If you can't write, read more. In my experience, writer's block is not a
> condition, but a result. Lots of people seem to think they can play video

> that way. You've got to put in time on input if you want good output.

When someone asked how he manages to publish everyday:
> I try very hard to read a lot and write a lot.

And when asked about his inspiration:
> I really just try to read a lot, think a lot, then write for an hour a day. I
> also schedule my life a lot. So far that seems to be working all right.

On what to read:
> It's very liberating to read a book on a subject you think is boring. You
> might end up surprised.

> I read pretttty much anything.

His broader philosophy here:

> Most people tend to like what they like. I try to like things I dislike.

Why does he read so much?

He's not the first to push the virtues of reading. Warren Buffet says his secret
is
["reading 500 pages a day."](http://theweek.com/article/index/248655/the-warren-buffett-formula-how-you-can-get-smarter)
Alan Kay reportedly attempts to
[read a book a day](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7547300). Who knows how
much Chomsky reads? Stephen King says, “If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.” And so on.
