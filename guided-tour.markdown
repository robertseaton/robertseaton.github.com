## Practical and self-development posts
* Did you know that women in the 1700s would put poison in their eyes to maximize their allure? I was fed up with pick up artists pushing the power eye contact without any evidence, so I dug into the literature and wrote [**an evidenced-based article on eye contact**](http://rs.io/2014/06/01/prolonged-eye-contact.html). 
* People overvalue shiny, new technologies, and undervalue old, super-effective technologies, like the checklist. If you're not already a checklist zealot, you'll benefit from this [**review of the effectiveness of checklists**](http://rs.io/2014/05/12/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-checklists.html). 
* Life can be thought of as a series of problems, so I wrote a post about [**the science of problem solving**](http://rs.io/2014/02/21/problem-solving.html).
* Humans are [**habit executors**](http://rs.io/2014/02/08/habit.html): machines that just replay the same behaviors  over and over, plus how you can hack your own habit formation in pursuit of your goals.
* [**On human expertise**](http://rs.io/2014/01/20/human-expertise-and-memory-machines.html) and the role long-term memory plays in skill improvement and human cognition.
* On [**modeling yourself as not one agent, but many competing agents**](http://rs.io/2013/12/14/the-examined-life.html) that happen to share a head.
* Richard Hamming famously said, "If you don't work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work," so I wrote about [**what it is that makes a problem important**](http://rs.io/2013/07/15/what-makes-a-problem-important.html).

## Computers and software
* [**How to use software to improve your writing.**](http://rs.io/2014/03/07/tools-for-writing.html)
* Once I became convinced that long-term memory places a central role in expertise, I started to commit lots of stuff to memory. I wrote [**a retrospective on what I'd learned after memorizing my 10,000th flashcard**](http://rs.io/2014/04/05/anki-10000-cards-later.html). (Check out also my post [**on the importance of "Why?" questions**](http://rs.io/2014/02/25/why-questions-reveal-structure.html).)
* Simulated annealing is a beautiful heuristic search algorithm, although don't let that jargon turn you off! I've put together [**a picture guide to simulated annealing**](http://rs.io/2014/02/16/simulated-annealing-intuition.html).


![Drawing of recipe book. Caption: "People on the internet love lists... Why aren't there any books that are just lists?"](/img/recipe-book-comic.png)

## I've made a lot of lists of surprising stuff, like...
* Did you know that [there are probably about four unobserved planet-like objects that are three times the size of Pluto, the largest may be as large as Earth or Mars](http://rs.io/2014/04/07/links-for-april.html)?
* Or that [male dolphins have been observed wrapping a wriggling eel around their penises, as a form of masturbation](http://rs.io/2014/04/19/more-links-for-april.html)?
* What about that [more expensive wine doesn't taste better](http://rs.io/2014/05/02/links-for-may.html)? 
* Or that, in 2013, [$5.3 trillion dollars changed hands daily in foreign exchange markets](http://rs.io/2014/05/15/more-links-for-may.html)?
* How about that [people with wet earwax have stronger body odor](http://rs.io/2014/06/02/surprising-june.html)?
* Did you know that [there used to be a flying reptile that was as tall as a giraffe](http://rs.io/2014/02/05/links-for-february.html)?
* Or that winning the [lottery makes people more right-wing?](http://rs.io/2014/02/20/more-links-for-february.html)
* What about that [men and women both find the opposite sex more attractive when they wear the color red](http://rs.io/2014/03/06/links-for-march.html)?
* How about that [marriages arranged through the mail-order services would appear to have a lower divorce rate than the nation as a whole](http://rs.io/2014/03/22/more-links-for-march.html)?
* And I maintain [a very popular list of data sets](http://rs.io/2014/05/29/list-of-data-sets.html).

## Mathematics and relationships
* I've written a bit about the intersection between mathematics and human relationships. My [**writeup of the secretary problem**](http://rs.io/2014/03/03/the-secretary-problem.html), for example, is about how to decide when to *stop* dating and settle down, while my post [**on the stable marriage problem**](http://rs.io/2014/03/15/the-stable-marriage-problem.html) is about how to pair people off such that there's no risk of divorce.

## Just mathematics
* There's been a lot of buzz around category theory, and I wanted to know what it was about, so [**I found out**](http://rs.io/2014/04/30/why-category-theory-matters.html).
* Interested in [**math jokes**](http://rs.io/2014/04/17/math-jokes.html)? See also [**this one**](http://rs.io/2014/02/27/statistician-on-a-plane.html). Or how [**about quotes**](http://rs.io/2013/09/19/quotes-on-mathematics.html)?
* [**Why do people bother with mathematical proof, anyways?**](http://rs.io/2014/04/09/mathematical-proof-is-about-insight.html)
* [**If a man has at least one boy child, what are the odds that the other is a boy?**](http://rs.io/2014/03/05/the-boy-girl-paradox.html) (It's not what you think!)
* [**Math as worldbuilding.**](http://rs.io/2014/02/28/worldbuilding-and-mathematics.html)
* [**Picasso as a mathematician.**](http://rs.io/2013/08/28/picasso-as-a-mathematician.html)

## Just relationships
* [**Are women more likely to break up with men or vice versa?**](http://rs.io/2014/03/14/female-is-the-heartbreaker.html)
* I once wrote about [the curious tendency of women to be vegans](http://rs.io/2013/09/25/chicks-dig-veganism.html).

## Original research and creativity
* I've done some original research on the relationship between creativity and compression. To understand it, you should first read [**this post**](http://rs.io/2014/02/22/ju%CC%88rgen-schmidhuber-creativity.html), and then check out my post [**testing the theory on literature and non-creative works**](http://rs.io/2014/03/24/creative-process-no-mystery.html), and my follow up, [**testing the theory on creative and exceptionally creative works**](http://rs.io/2014/04/04/creativity-fan-fiction-and-literature.html).
* In the same vein, I've written a few different posts on creativity, including one on [**how Zach Weinersmith (of *Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal* fame) comes up with his ideas**](http://rs.io/2014/04/07/zach-weinersmith-on-reading.html), about [**incrementalism**](http://rs.io/2014/03/24/creative-process-no-mystery.html), and about [**brainstorming via narrowing**](http://rs.io/2014/02/27/narrow-to-generate-ideas.html).

## Theories
* I've written a number of theory or idea posts, sort of stabs at explanations. The most popular explains [**how people online are like vampire bats and is on why online communities decay over time**](http://rs.io/2014/02/26/why-online-communities-decay-over-time.html).
* [**Science as algorithm discovery.**](http://rs.io/2014/04/10/solomonoff-induction.html)
* [Herbert Simon's Ant: how complex seeming behavior can arise from complex environments and simple agents.](http://rs.io/2014/04/08/herbert-simons-ant.html)
* Did you know that there's a type of sea slug that can undergo photosynthesis after eating plants and sting after consuming jellyfish? This and more in my post on [**why we should all identify as a sponge**](http://rs.io/2014/03/10/deconstruct-and-absorb.html). 
* [In which I propose a new way to think about rules and rule-breaking.](http://rs.io/2014/01/08/rules-are-rules.html)
* [Could universes evolve and reproduce via black holes?](http://rs.io/2013/11/24/the-blind-universemaker.html) 
* When trying something new, [start with the dumbest thing that could work and then iterate](http://rs.io/2013/10/18/the-dumbest-thing-that-could-work.html).
